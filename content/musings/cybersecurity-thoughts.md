# We Just Stopped Watching Russia and That's Terrifying

*Why treating cybersecurity like a popularity contest is incredibly dangerous*

---

So apparently the U.S. has decided that Russia just isn't that interesting anymore from a cybersecurity perspective. The new plan is to focus on China instead, because apparently we can only worry about one major cyber threat at a time.

This feels like deciding to ignore one armed robber because you spotted another one across the street.

---

## The Logic That Makes No Sense

Here's the thinking: China is becoming the bigger cyber threat, so let's shift our attention there and deprioritize Russia.

**On paper, this might sound reasonable.** China is definitely expanding their cyber capabilities. They're stealing intellectual property, conducting espionage, and building sophisticated attack infrastructure.

**In reality, this is incredibly naive.** 

Cyber threats don't work like a video game where you can pause one boss fight to handle another. Russia didn't suddenly become harmless because China got more attention.

---

## Russia Didn't Get the Memo

Let's talk about Russia's greatest hits:

**SolarWinds hack** - Compromised 18,000 organizations including multiple government agencies
**NotPetya attacks** - Caused billions in damage to global infrastructure  
**Election interference** - Ongoing operations targeting democratic processes
**Colonial Pipeline** - Shut down critical energy infrastructure

These weren't pranks or amateur hour operations. They were sophisticated, coordinated attacks that had real consequences for national security and the economy.

**And here's the kicker:** None of this stopped when we decided China was more important.

## The Burglar Analogy

Imagine you know someone's been trying to break into your house for years. They've already gotten in a few times, stolen things, left nasty surprises. You've seen them casing the place, testing your locks, learning your routines.

Then you hear about break-ins happening across town by a different group.

Do you:
A) Stop locking your doors because the other group seems more active lately
B) Secure your house against both threats

Apparently, U.S. cybersecurity policy chose option A.

## What Could Go Wrong (Spoiler: Everything)

### More Unchecked Russian Activity
When you stop actively monitoring and deterring a threat, that threat doesn't disappear. It gets bolder.

Russia's cyber units are still operational, still funded, still looking for opportunities. Less attention from the U.S. means more room for them to operate.

### Coordinated Attacks
Russia and China don't need to be best friends to find common ground in weakening U.S. infrastructure.

What happens when they decide to coordinate attacks? While we're focused on defending against Chinese espionage, Russian hackers could be setting up infrastructure attacks. Or vice versa.

### Reactive Instead of Proactive Defense
Instead of preventing attacks, we'll be responding to them after the damage is done.

**Scenario:** Russian hackers target power grids while everyone's focused on Chinese intellectual property theft. By the time we realize what's happening, the lights are already out.

---

## The Internet Doesn't Care About Our Priorities

Here's what cybersecurity experts understand that policymakers apparently don't:

**Cyber threats are simultaneous, not sequential.** You can't pause one while dealing with another.

**Attack infrastructure stays active regardless of political focus.** Russian hacker groups didn't shut down their operations when the U.S. shifted priorities.

**Deterrence requires consistent attention.** The moment you signal that a threat isn't a priority, you invite escalation.

**Defense requires comprehensive coverage.** You can't just defend against the threat you're most worried about this week.

---

## What This Really Means

### For Government Systems
Critical infrastructure becomes more vulnerable to Russian attacks while defenses focus elsewhere.

### For Private Companies
Businesses may deprioritize Russian threat intelligence, leaving them exposed to attacks they're not monitoring.

### For National Security
We're essentially telling Russia that they have more room to operate as long as they stay out of the spotlight.

---

## The Smarter Approach

**Recognize that both threats are active simultaneously**
China and Russia aren't taking turns attacking U.S. systems. They're both active all the time.

**Invest in comprehensive defense capabilities**
Build systems that can detect and respond to multiple threat actors simultaneously.

**Maintain intelligence operations on all major adversaries**
Just because one threat seems more pressing doesn't mean you stop watching the others.

**Coordinate international responses**
Work with allies who may have different threat priorities to maintain coverage.

---

## Why This Feels Personal

I've watched cybersecurity evolve from an IT afterthought to a national security priority. The progress has been slow but real.

**This decision feels like a step backward.**

It's the kind of thinking that led to major breaches in the past - assuming that threats are predictable, manageable, and mutually exclusive.

The reality is messier. Cyber warfare doesn't follow neat rules or take turns. Multiple adversaries operate simultaneously, often exploiting exactly the kind of attention gaps we're creating.

---

## The Bottom Line

**Cybersecurity isn't a zero-sum game.** Focusing on China doesn't require ignoring Russia.

**Threat actors don't respect our priority lists.** Russia's capabilities didn't diminish just because we decided China was more important.

**Defense requires comprehensive coverage.** You can't just defend against this week's favorite threat.

**History suggests this will backfire.** Every time we've underestimated or deprioritized a cyber adversary, we've paid for it later.

The internet has no borders, and cyber warfare doesn't operate on a ranking system. Treating national cybersecurity like we can only handle one major threat at a time is dangerously naive.

**China is absolutely a serious cyber threat that deserves attention and resources.**

**So is Russia.**

**We need to be capable of handling both simultaneously.**

Because I guarantee you, they're both planning to handle us simultaneously.

*In cybersecurity, the cost of getting it wrong isn't just embarrassment or lost data - it's national security. We can't afford to play favorites with threats that don't play by our rules.*
