Hey there! I'm Ben—a husband and proud dad first and foremost. My wife and I share our life with two amazing little humans: our curious and energetic 4-year-old son, and our sweet, adventurous 1-year-old daughter. They're my world and keep me happily busy, endlessly entertained, and constantly inspired.

When I'm not in full-on dad mode, you'll probably find me deeply immersed in my homelab. My basement hums gently with servers, virtual machines, and containers, where I geek out over advanced networking setups, robust automation, and cutting-edge AI workflows. I'm currently exploring some exciting development projects around generative AI, automation frameworks, and personal productivity dashboards—always looking for innovative ways to bridge tech and daily life.

Outside the tech realm, I have a deep appreciation for historic architecture—I proudly own and continually renovate an 1800s farmhouse in southeastern Pennsylvania, near Philadelphia. On our 10 acres of land, I enjoy tending to the property, maintaining gardens, and caring for an ever-growing collection of cactuses (yes, even in Pennsylvania!).

I'm also a passionate sports fan: you can often find me cheering for the Pittsburgh Penguins during hockey season and rooting for Penn State Football every fall. And when I can carve out some free time, you'll catch me in the garage working on my modified BMW 135i—another ongoing project that keeps my hands busy and my mind engaged.

Professionally, I've spent over a decade leading high-performing data science teams at large companies and federal agencies. My focus is always on bridging the gap between complex technology and real-world business impact—making sure our work actually matters, not just dazzles. I've built analytics organizations from scratch, managed multimillion-dollar budgets, and navigated the tricky waters of enterprise strategy and innovation.

At my core, though, I'm driven by curiosity. Whether it's homelab tinkering, exploring AI breakthroughs, restoring historic charm, or fine-tuning cars, I’m always looking for ways to grow, optimize, and build things that matter.

Thanks for stopping by my little digital corner. I’m glad you're here—feel free to reach out, ask questions, or just say hi!
