Hey there! I'm Ben—a husband and dad first and foremost. My wife and I have two amazing kids: a spirited 4-year-old son and a bubbly 1-year-old daughter. They're my absolute everything, keeping me equal parts exhausted, entertained, and inspired every single day.

When I'm not chasing toddlers around the house, you'll probably find me diving deep into my homelab projects—think servers quietly humming in the basement, overly-complicated VLAN setups, or tweaking AI models at odd hours. I'm a huge nerd for self-hosting, automation, and anything that blinks or beeps.

Professionally, I lead data science and AI initiatives, building teams that turn fancy tech into practical value. But at the end of the day, I'm still just a kid who loves playing with the coolest toys in tech and seeing what happens.

Welcome to my little corner of the internet. Glad you're here!
