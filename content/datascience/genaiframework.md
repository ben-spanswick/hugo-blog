# Building AI That Actually Reads Documents (Instead of Just Pretending To)

*How we built a system that can handle thousands of legal docs without hallucinating*

---

We had a problem. A big one.

Our legal team was drowning in documents - contracts, case law, regulatory filings, thousands of pages of dense text that someone needed to actually understand. The usual approach of "hire more paralegals" wasn't working, and basic search was like trying to find a needle in a haystack made of other needles.

ChatGPT? Great for writing emails, terrible for legal research. It would confidently cite cases that didn't exist and misquote clauses from contracts. Not exactly what you want when accuracy matters.

So we built something better. A system that combines multiple AI approaches to actually understand documents, track its sources, and admit when it doesn't know something.

Here's how we did it (and how you can adapt it for your own document nightmares).

---

## Why Basic AI Solutions Don't Work for Serious Documents

### The Hallucination Problem
Ask ChatGPT about a specific contract clause, and it might give you a beautifully written answer that's completely made up. For casual use? Maybe okay. For legal work? Career-ending.

### The Context Problem  
Most AI systems can only look at small chunks of text at once. But real questions often require understanding connections across multiple documents, sections, and time periods.

### The Citation Problem
"The AI said so" isn't a valid source. You need to know exactly where information comes from, with page numbers and direct quotes.

### The Precision Problem
In domains like law or medicine, words matter. Paraphrasing can change meaning completely. Sometimes you need the exact original text, not an AI's interpretation.

## The Stack That Actually Works

### Beyond Basic RAG
Everyone's doing Retrieval Augmented Generation now - find relevant text chunks, feed them to an LLM, get an answer. It's a start, but it has serious limitations:

- Can't reason across multiple documents
- Misses context spread across sections  
- Terrible at citations
- No way to prioritize authoritative sources

We use RAG as a foundation, then add several layers on top.

### LexRank: The Summarization Secret Weapon
While everyone obsesses over RAG, fewer people know about LexRank. It's an algorithm that finds the most important sentences in a document by treating them like a network and finding the most "central" ones.

**Why it matters:** LexRank extracts actual sentences from documents instead of generating new text. When precise wording matters (like in legal or technical docs), this is huge.

### Vector Databases: Choosing Your Retrieval Engine
We tested several options:

**Pinecone:** Fast but limited filtering  
**Weaviate:** Great hybrid search, more complex setup  
**Chroma:** Simple but doesn't scale well  
**Azure AI Search:** Good all-around with strong enterprise features

We went with Weaviate for its hybrid search - combining semantic similarity with traditional keyword matching.

### Hierarchical Chunking
Instead of chopping documents into random pieces, we create multiple levels:

1. **Document-level** - for initial filtering
2. **Section-level** - for main retrieval  
3. **Paragraph-level** - for detailed extraction
4. **Sentence-level** - for LexRank analysis

This lets the system zoom in and out as needed.

## The Document Processing Pipeline

### Making Sense of Messy Documents

Most documents are a mess - scanned PDFs, weird formatting, inconsistent structure. The preprocessing stage is crucial:

**Format conversion:** Get everything into clean text  
**Structure preservation:** Keep headings, lists, formatting  
**Metadata extraction:** Pull out dates, authors, document types  
**Entity recognition:** Find organizations, people, legal citations  
**Cross-reference detection:** Map connections between documents

*Pro tip: Spend time here. Garbage in, garbage out applies 10x to document AI.*

### Smart Chunking Strategy

```python
def create_hierarchical_chunks(document):
    # Document-level embedding for broad filtering
    doc_embedding = embed_text(document.full_text)
    
    # Section-level chunks based on headings
    sections = split_by_headings(document.full_text)
    section_chunks = []
    for section in sections:
        section_chunks.append({
            "text": section,
            "embedding": embed_text(section),
            "metadata": document.metadata
        })
    
    # Paragraph-level for detailed retrieval
    paragraph_chunks = []
    for section in sections:
        paragraphs = split_by_paragraphs(section)
        for paragraph in paragraphs:
            paragraph_chunks.append({
                "text": paragraph,
                "embedding": embed_text(paragraph),
                "parent_section": section[:100]
            })
    
    return {
        "document": doc_embedding,
        "sections": section_chunks,
        "paragraphs": paragraph_chunks
    }
```

### Quality Control That Matters

Not all documents are equal. We built scoring systems for:

**Authority:** Government sources > company documents > random PDFs  
**Recency:** Newer regulations override older ones  
**Completeness:** Full documents > partial extracts  
**Consistency:** Flag contradictory information  
**Relevance:** Domain-specific relevance scoring

---

## The Retrieval Engine

### Multi-Stage Retrieval Process

Single-stage retrieval misses too much. Our process:

1. **Query analysis** - understand what type of info is needed
2. **Corpus filtering** - narrow search space using document-level embeddings  
3. **Primary retrieval** - find most relevant sections
4. **Context expansion** - add related paragraphs for complete picture
5. **Re-ranking** - apply domain-specific relevance criteria

### Beyond Vector Similarity

Vector similarity alone isn't enough. We combine:

**Semantic similarity** - core vector search  
**Term overlap** - keyword matching for precision  
**Authority weighting** - prioritize reliable sources  
**Recency factors** - newer info when relevant  
**Context relevance** - how chunks fit together  

```python
def score_chunk(chunk, query, other_chunks):
    # Base similarity
    vector_score = vector_similarity(chunk.embedding, query_embedding)
    
    # Keyword matching
    term_score = calculate_term_overlap(chunk.text, query)
    
    # Source authority
    authority_score = get_authority_score(chunk.metadata)
    
    # How well it fits with other results
    context_score = calculate_context_fit(chunk, other_chunks)
    
    # Weighted combination
    return (vector_score * 0.4 + term_score * 0.2 + 
            authority_score * 0.2 + context_score * 0.2)
```

### Citation Tracking from Day One

Every piece of information needs a paper trail:

**Source document** with full metadata  
**Specific location** (page, section, paragraph)  
**Direct quotes** vs paraphrased content  
**Confidence scores** for each claim  
**Proper formatting** for domain standards

---

## The Summarization Layer

### LexRank in Action

```python
def lexrank_summarize(chunks, num_sentences=5):
    # Extract all sentences
    sentences = []
    for chunk in chunks:
        chunk_sentences = split_into_sentences(chunk.text)
        sentences.extend(chunk_sentences)
    
    # Create similarity matrix between sentences
    embeddings = [embed_text(s) for s in sentences]
    similarity_matrix = cosine_similarity(embeddings)
    
    # Apply threshold to create graph
    similarity_matrix[similarity_matrix < 0.3] = 0
    
    # Calculate centrality scores (like PageRank)
    scores = calculate_lexrank_scores(similarity_matrix)
    
    # Return top sentences with their sources
    ranked = [(sentences[i], scores[i]) for i in range(len(sentences))]
    ranked.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    
    return ranked[:num_sentences]
```

### Combining RAG + LexRank

The magic happens when you combine approaches:

1. **RAG finds relevant chunks** based on query
2. **LexRank identifies key sentences** within those chunks  
3. **LLM synthesizes** both into coherent answer
4. **Citations preserved** throughout process

This gives you the breadth of RAG with the precision of extractive summarization.

### Fact Verification Pipeline

```python
def verify_response(generated_text, source_chunks):
    # Extract specific claims from generated response
    claims = extract_claims(generated_text)
    
    # Check each claim against source material
    verification_results = []
    for claim in claims:
        supporting_evidence = find_support(claim, source_chunks)
        contradicting_evidence = find_contradictions(claim, source_chunks)
        
        verification_results.append({
            "claim": claim,
            "supported": len(supporting_evidence) > 0,
            "confidence": calculate_support_strength(supporting_evidence),
            "sources": [s.metadata for s in supporting_evidence]
        })
    
    return annotate_response(generated_text, verification_results)
```

## Making It User-Friendly

### The Agentic Layer

Instead of rigid workflows, we built an agent that:

**Interprets queries** to understand intent  
**Plans retrieval strategy** based on question type  
**Adapts approach** based on results  
**Maintains context** across follow-up questions  
**Explains reasoning** throughout process

### Query Understanding

Users don't always ask good questions. We help by:

**Classifying question types** (factual, analytical, comparative)  
**Expanding queries** with relevant terms  
**Resolving ambiguities** through clarification  
**Decomposing complex questions** into manageable parts

### Result Presentation

The output format matters as much as the content:

**Structured responses** with clear sections  
**Inline citations** linked to sources  
**Confidence indicators** for different claims  
**Direct quotes** for key points  
**Source summary** at the end

## Real-World Results: Legal Research Case Study

### The Challenge
Law firm with thousands of contracts, case law, and regulatory docs needed to:
- Find relevant precedents quickly
- Extract key contract clauses  
- Track regulatory changes
- Generate properly cited memos

### What We Built

**Specialized legal parsers** for different document types  
**Authority-weighted retrieval** prioritizing official sources  
**Jurisdiction-based filtering** for relevant law  
**Citation graph analysis** for precedent relationships  
**Extractive summarization** preserving exact legal language

### The Results

**Research time reduced by 70%** for complex questions  
**95% accuracy rate** vs expert-generated answers  
**Zero hallucinated citations** (the big win)  
**Full audit trail** for every piece of information

### What We Learned

**Domain-specific chunking is crucial** - legal docs have unique structure  
**Authority trumps recency** - older authoritative sources often win  
**Citation precision is non-negotiable** - even small errors kill trust  
**Explanation matters** - lawyers want to understand the reasoning

---

## Making It Modular

### Component Architecture

**Document Processor** - handles ingestion and chunking  
**Embedding Service** - manages vector representations  
**Retrieval Engine** - finds relevant information  
**Summarization Service** - applies LexRank and other techniques  
**Response Generator** - creates final output  
**Interaction Manager** - handles user queries

Each component has clean interfaces and can be swapped independently.

### Configuration-Driven Customization

```yaml
domain_config:
  name: "legal_research"
  
  chunking:
    strategy: "hierarchical"
    max_chunk_size: 1000
    
  retrieval:
    top_k: 25
    reranking: true
    
  summarization:
    primary_method: "lexrank"
    min_sentences: 3
    
  response:
    citation_format: "bluebook"
    include_confidence: true
```

This lets you adapt to new domains without code changes.

## The Bottom Line

Basic AI tools aren't ready for serious document work. But combining multiple approaches - RAG for retrieval, LexRank for summarization, vector databases for search, and careful engineering for accuracy - can create something genuinely useful.

**Key lessons:**
- **Go beyond basic RAG** - combine multiple techniques
- **Invest heavily in document processing** - garbage in, garbage out
- **Make modularity a priority** - design for reuse from day one  
- **Focus on attribution** - citations build trust and enable verification
- **Adapt to your domain** - one size doesn't fit all

The future of document AI isn't about replacing human expertise. It's about augmenting it with tools that can actually handle the volume and complexity of modern information.

If you're drowning in documents and need more than basic search, this modular approach provides a foundation you can build on.

Just remember: the goal isn't to build the fanciest AI system. It's to build one that actually works when accuracy matters.

*After building this across legal, medical, and financial document sets, the pattern is clear: success comes from combining multiple approaches thoughtfully, not from finding one magic solution.*
