# My Kids Accidentally Made Me a Better Data Leader

*What a 1-year-old and 4-year-old taught me about managing teams*

---

I thought I had leadership figured out. Read all the right books, attended the workshops, considered myself pretty good with people. Then I became a dad and realized I knew absolutely nothing.

My 1-year-old daughter and 4-year-old son don't care about my MBA or how many data scientists I've managed. They just want me to understand them, be curious with them, and not lose my mind when things go sideways.

Turns out, that's exactly what my data teams needed too.

After four years of fumbling through both parenting and leadership simultaneously, I've discovered that toddlers make surprisingly good leadership coaches. They've completely changed how I think about empathy, curiosity, and creating safe spaces for people to grow.

Here's what they taught me.

## Lesson 1: Actually Listen Before You Try to Fix Everything

My 1-year-old can't tell me what's wrong when she's upset. She just cries. So I've become a detective - is she hungry? Tired? Frustrated that she can't reach her toy? I have to put aside whatever I was doing and really pay attention to understand what she needs.

This completely changed how I handle team problems.

**Before kids:** Someone comes to me with an issue, I immediately start problem-solving.

**After kids:** I force myself to understand first, solve second.

Instead of jumping to solutions, I started asking things like:
- "Help me understand what you're experiencing"
- "What's the most frustrating part of this for you?"
- "Walk me through how this feels from your perspective"

The difference has been huge. When we actually understand the real problem - not just the surface symptoms - our solutions actually work.

One data scientist came to me complaining about "technical debt in our models." My old approach would have been to immediately discuss refactoring strategies. Instead, I asked her to help me understand what she was experiencing day-to-day.

Turns out the real issue wasn't technical debt - it was that she felt like her work wasn't valued because leadership kept asking for quick fixes instead of letting her build things properly. Completely different problem, completely different solution.

## Lesson 2: Ask "Why" Like Your Job Depends on It

My 4-year-old asks "why" about everything. And I mean everything.

"Why is the sky blue?"
"Why do cars have wheels?"
"Why do we brush our teeth?"

It's exhausting, but it's also brilliant. He doesn't accept "that's just how things are" as an answer.

I started bringing that same energy to work, and it's been a game-changer.

**In strategy meetings, I became the annoying person asking:**
- "Why do we structure our data this way?"
- "Why is this the process we follow?"
- "Why do we think this approach is best?"

At first, people were a bit put off. These questions can feel naive when you're deep in expertise. But they've led to some of our biggest breakthroughs.

One simple "why do we run this report weekly instead of daily?" led us to redesign the entire process and improve data freshness by 80%. Sometimes the most basic questions unlock the biggest improvements.

I now schedule "fundamental questioning" sessions quarterly where we deliberately challenge our basic assumptions. The only rule: every "why" gets a real answer, not defensiveness.

## Lesson 3: Learn Stuff Together (Even When You Don't Know the Answer)

Watching my daughter discover shadows for the first time, or my son realize he can mix colors to make new ones - the pure joy of discovery is infectious.

And here's the thing: I'm learning right alongside them. I don't have all the answers about why leaves change color or how airplanes stay up. We figure it out together.

This completely changed how I approach new challenges at work.

**Instead of feeling like I need to be the expert on everything, I started saying:** "I don't know, let's figure it out together."

When we needed to implement a new computer vision system, instead of bringing in external consultants, I formed a learning team. I participated not as the leader with all the answers, but as someone equally curious about how this technology worked.

The project took a bit longer than it might have with outside experts, but something amazing happened - the entire team's confidence and capability grew exponentially. They owned the solution because they built it together.

The best leaders I know aren't the ones with the most expertise. They're the ones who create environments where everyone gets to discover and learn together.

## Lesson 4: Make It Safe to Mess Up

My son built this elaborate castle out of magnetic tiles last week. Spent 30 minutes on it, was so proud. Then he accidentally knocked it over while reaching for something.

I was ready for a meltdown. Instead, he looked at the pieces and said, "Now I can build something even cooler!" and started over.

That resilience didn't happen overnight. It developed because we've always treated mistakes as learning opportunities, not disasters.

I realized my data teams needed that same psychological safety.

**I started being more open about my own mistakes:**
- Sharing my "learning moments" in team meetings
- Running "failure retrospectives" focused on what we learned, not who screwed up
- Celebrating bold attempts, even when they didn't work out

After one particularly visible project failure, instead of looking for someone to blame, I guided the team through a learning-focused retrospective. The insights from that session informed our next attempt, which became one of our most successful initiatives.

More importantly, people started proposing bolder ideas because they weren't afraid of being punished for trying something that might not work.

## What Changed (And What It Actually Looks Like)

### Before Kids (The "Expert" Approach)
- Jump straight to solutions when people bring problems
- Feel pressure to have all the answers
- Focus on individual performance and expertise
- Treat mistakes as problems to be avoided

### After Kids (The "Human" Approach)
- Listen first, understand the real problem, then solve
- Comfortable saying "I don't know, let's learn together"
- Focus on team learning and collective capability
- Treat mistakes as opportunities to get better

### The Practical Results

**Employee satisfaction around "feeling heard" went up 42%** in six months after we implemented the "understand first" approach.

**Innovation attempts increased significantly** after we created psychological safety around failure.

**Team capability grew faster** when we learned new technologies together instead of always bringing in outside experts.

**Better solutions** emerged when we actually understood problems before trying to fix them.

## The Uncomfortable Truth About Technical Leadership

Here's what parenting taught me that all the leadership books missed: 

**Technical expertise isn't what makes great leaders.** The ability to create environments where people feel understood, curious, and safe to try things - that's what makes great leaders.

**The smartest person in the room isn't always the best leader.** Sometimes the best leader is the person asking the most basic questions or admitting they don't know something.

**Innovation requires psychological safety.** People won't propose creative solutions if they're afraid of looking stupid or being blamed when things don't work perfectly.

**Real empathy is work.** It means putting aside your own agenda and really trying to understand someone else's experience. It's harder than technical problem-solving, but it's what actually moves teams forward.

## What This Looks Like in Practice

### Start Every Problem Conversation with Understanding
Instead of: "Here's how we should fix this"
Try: "Help me understand what you're experiencing"

### Ask Fundamental Questions Regularly  
Instead of: Accepting "that's how we've always done it"
Try: "Why is this the best approach for what we're trying to achieve?"

### Learn Alongside Your Team
Instead of: "I'll bring in an expert to teach you"
Try: "I don't know this either - let's figure it out together"

### Make Failure Safe
Instead of: "Who made this mistake?"
Try: "What can we learn from this that will help us next time?"

## The Bottom Line

My kids don't care about my technical credentials or management philosophy. They just want me to pay attention, be curious, and create a safe space for them to grow and explore.

Turns out, that's exactly what data teams need too.

The best technical leaders aren't the ones with the most expertise - they're the ones who can create environments where everyone feels heard, stays curious, and isn't afraid to try new things.

So if your leadership approach feels stale, maybe the best teachers aren't in the boardroom or business books. Maybe they're the ones asking "why" for the hundredth time today while building something amazing out of blocks.

*Four years into this parenting and leadership journey, I'm convinced that the soft skills matter way more than the technical ones. My kids keep teaching me that every day.*
