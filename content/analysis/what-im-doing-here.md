### A running analysis of how global power is being reorganized, one region at a time

---

In early 2025, I started noticing that a lot of things that were being covered as separate news stories seemed to be connected. An ExxonMobil production ramp in a country most people couldn't find on a map. A wave of Chinese port operators getting pushed out of the Western Hemisphere. A tariff regime that was simultaneously the highest since World War II and riddled with exemptions that lined up suspiciously well by geography. An icebreaker deal with Finland. A $500 billion quarter in AI infrastructure spending. A labor crackdown that looked like immigration enforcement but operated like industrial policy.

None of these stories, taken individually, seemed like the biggest deal in the world. But when I started mapping them together, I kept arriving at the same picture: a hemispheric system being assembled in pieces, with each piece serving a specific structural role, and most of the assembly happening in plain sight through public data, signed contracts, tariff schedules, and treaty texts.

I don't think this is a conspiracy. I think it's something more interesting than that -- a case of convergent evolution, where distinct factions (economic nationalists, defense hawks, Wall Street, Big Tech) are each pursuing their own rational interests and arriving at a common destination. The architecture is emerging from aligned incentives rather than a single master plan, which makes it both more durable than most people assume and more fragile in ways that aren't obvious.

This blog is my attempt to trace that architecture in detail, one piece at a time, using public sources and showing my work.

## The Western Hemisphere Series

The first and most developed series covers what I've been calling (in my own notes, not in the posts themselves) the "Fortress Hemisphere" -- the consolidation of the Western Hemisphere into a self-sufficient industrial, energy, and security bloc designed to insulate the US economy from Eurasian instability.

The posts are meant to be read in order. Each one covers a different pillar of the architecture and builds on what came before.

**[Post 1: Follow the Pipes](/analysis/follow-the-pipes/)** -- How Guyana, a country of 800,000 people that wasn't producing oil in 2018, is on track to pump 1.7 million barrels per day by 2030 and why that matters for everything that follows. The energy foundation.

**[Post 2: The Squeeze](/analysis/the-squeeze/)** -- The systematic removal of Chinese infrastructure from hemispheric ports, telecom networks, and logistics chains. Not a single dramatic confrontation but a slow, deliberate clearing of the board.

**[Post 3: The Factory Next Door](/analysis/the-factory-next-door/)** -- Mexico's $840 billion trade relationship with the US, the USMCA mechanics that make it work, and why Monterrey is absorbing 89% of the country's manufacturing growth. The hemispheric production layer.

**[Post 4: The Trillion-Dollar Tell](/analysis/the-trillion-dollar-tell/)** -- The contradiction at the center: the US is building a manufacturing architecture that depends on cheap human labor while simultaneously eliminating cheap human labor through enforcement. Why $650+ billion in AI infrastructure spending might be the tell that resolves the contradiction, and what happens if the robots aren't ready in time.

**[Post 5: The Roof](/analysis/the-roof/)** -- The Arctic pillar. America's 48-year-old icebreaker fleet, the ICE Pact with Finland and Canada, shipping routes opening through the Northwest Passage, Russia and China building a Polar Silk Road, and Greenland sitting in the middle of all of it with 36-42 million metric tons of rare earth oxides underneath the ice.

**Coming next:** Critical minerals -- lithium in Argentina, copper in the Andes, rare earths in Greenland, and the global resource competition that connects them. After that, the Silk Road and Belt and Road Initiative, and how China's infrastructure strategy extends well beyond shipping lanes.

## Dispatches

Alongside the main series, I write occasional dispatches covering current events that connect back to the architecture. These are more editorial, more time-sensitive, and more explicitly my take on what just happened and what it means.

**[The Greenland Debacle](/dispatches/the-greenland-debacle/)** -- What five days in January 2026 revealed about the distance between the strategy and the strategist. The structural case for deeper US engagement in Greenland is real. The execution was a disaster. What that tells you about the system's deepest vulnerability.

More dispatches will come as events warrant -- the USMCA review in July 2026, whatever happens with the Section 122 tariff expiry, the next flare-up that stress-tests the framework.

## Deep Dives

Some topics need more space than a series post allows, or they're analytical in a way that doesn't fit the narrative structure. These are standalone data-heavy pieces that go deep on one specific mechanism.

**[The Firewall with Ports](/deep-dives/the-firewall-with-ports/)** -- A detailed breakdown of the US tariff regime: headline rates versus effective rates, the exemption architecture, how the SCOTUS IEEPA ruling changed the legal foundation without changing the strategic hierarchy, and an interactive visualization of what every major trade partner actually pays. The tariff as access control system.

## What's Ahead

The Western Hemisphere series is the foundation, but the architecture doesn't exist in a vacuum. Every move the US makes in the Americas is partially a response to what's happening on the other side of the world, and every country making choices about which tier to occupy is weighing offers from multiple directions.

Future series I'm planning to build out:

**Europe** -- How the EU is navigating between American economic pressure and its own strategic autonomy ambitions. The defense spending surge, the critical minerals partnerships, the tension between transatlantic alignment and European industrial policy. What the tariff deals with the UK, EU, and Switzerland actually locked in, and what they gave up.

**China and the Belt and Road** -- The other architecture. How China's infrastructure investments, commodity agreements, rare earth export controls, and the BRICS expansion are building an alternative system. The Polar Silk Road. The port network. The mineral hoarding strategy. Where it's working and where it's overextended.

**Africa and the AGOA Question** -- The continent both systems are competing for. The African Growth and Opportunity Act expired in September 2025 and hasn't been renewed. What that means, who's filling the vacuum, and why the mineral map makes Sub-Saharan Africa the next contested space.

**The Financial Architecture** -- The monetary system underneath all of it. Federal Reserve policy transmission, carry trade dynamics, dollar weaponization, de-dollarization efforts, and why the financial plumbing matters as much as the trade flows on top of it.

These are plans, not promises. The series will grow as events develop and as I have enough data to say something worth reading. I'd rather publish slowly and get it right than rush to cover everything.

## A Note on Method

Every factual claim in this blog is sourced to public data -- government filings, treaty texts, earnings reports, central bank communications, academic research, reputable journalism. I cite sources at the end of each post. Where I'm estimating or interpreting, I say so. Where the data is ambiguous, I flag the ambiguity.

The analytical framework -- the idea that these disparate developments form a coherent architecture -- is my interpretation. Reasonable people can disagree about whether this represents intentional coordination, emergent coherence from aligned incentives, or a pattern I'm imposing on noise. I try to be honest about where the evidence is strong and where I'm connecting dots that might not actually connect.

I'm not a credentialed policy analyst or an academic. I'm someone who reads a lot of primary sources, tracks data across multiple domains, and tries to synthesize it into something coherent. Take it for what it's worth, check my sources, and push back where I'm wrong.
