# About Me

![Ben Spanswick](/img/headshot.jpg)

Welcome to my blog. I’m **Ben Spanswick**, a data scientist, self-hosting enthusiast, and all-around tech tinkerer. This blog is a mix of deep dives into my personal projects, thoughts on emerging technology, and the occasional rant about what’s broken and how to fix it.

## What This Blog Is About
I built this blog as a **knowledge base** for my work, experiments, and ideas. It’s a place to document and share:
- **Self-hosted setups** – Infrastructure, automation, and security.
- **Data science insights** – Applications of AI, analytics, and machine learning.
- **Tech musings** – Thoughts on cybersecurity, AI ethics, and the future of computing.
- **Project breakdowns** – Everything from cloud deployments to home lab optimizations.

This blog is self-hosted, versioned with **Gitea**, mirrored to **GitHub**, and deployed via **Cloudflare Pages**.

## My Background
I work as a **Director of Data Science** at a large utility company, where I build **AI-driven analytics** for real-world impact. Over the years, I’ve developed expertise in:
- **Machine learning & AI**
- **Big data analytics**
- **Infrastructure automation**
- **Cloud and edge computing**
- **Security & self-hosting**

I’m always experimenting with new tools and technologies—whether it's running **Nextcloud** on my home server, optimizing **Hugo for blazing-fast site performance**, or integrating **LLMs into enterprise analytics**.
