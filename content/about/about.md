description: "Who I am and what this blog is about."

Hey there — I am Ben. Husband, dad, data science leader, homelab addict, and occasional policy wonk.

My wife and I share our life with two amazing kids in southeastern Pennsylvania, where we are slowly restoring an 1800s farmhouse on 10 acres. When I am not in dad mode, I am either elbow-deep in servers or reading about macroeconomics. Sometimes both.

## What This Blog Covers

**The Patch Panel** started as a place to document homelab builds and AI experiments. It has grown into something broader:

- **Tech** — AI, data science, cybersecurity, and the tech industry
- **Analysis** — Political, economic, and global policy think pieces
- **Projects** — Homelab builds, self-hosting, and hands-on technical work
- **Notes** — Short-form reactions and quick thoughts

The older posts from the original incarnation of this blog live in the [Archive](/archive/).

## Background

I have spent over a decade leading data science teams at large companies and federal agencies, building analytics organizations from scratch, managing multimillion-dollar budgets, and navigating enterprise strategy. Currently a Director of Data Science at a large utility company.

Outside of work: Pittsburgh Penguins hockey, Penn State football, a modified BMW 135i, and an ever-growing collection of cactuses.
