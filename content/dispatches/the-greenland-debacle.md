*This is a companion piece to [The Roof](/analysis/the-roof/), which covers the structural case for the Arctic: icebreakers, shipping routes, the ICE Pact. This one covers what happened when the quiet courtship turned into a public hostage negotiation.*

### Key Takeaways

- **The US has wanted Greenland for over 150 years** -- purchase offers in 1867, 1946, and 1955 -- but quiet structural courtship was already working before the crisis
- **Five days in January 2026 nearly fractured the Atlantic alliance** -- tariffs on eight NATO allies, European counter-tariffs of up to 108 billion euros, and the Anti-Coercion Instrument invoked for the first time
- **75% of Americans opposed taking control of Greenland** and only 4% supported military action, with even Republican allies calling it "beyond stupid"
- **The "framework deal" at Davos contained nothing new** -- collective Arctic security is literally NATO's existing mission, repackaged as a face-saving exit
- **The structural incentives survived the crisis** -- the ICE Pact, mineral cooperation, and independence trajectory all continued -- but the episode showed how fast executive action can damage the cooperation the system depends on

The United States has wanted Greenland for a long time. It offered to buy it in 1867. It proposed again in 1946. Military chiefs floated it again in 1955. The 1916 treaty where the US purchased the Danish West Indies -- what we now call the US Virgin Islands -- included a side declaration acknowledging Danish sovereignty over the whole island in exchange for Denmark not objecting to the Monroe Doctrine. Greenland has been on the American strategic wish list for over 150 years.

And for most of that time, the interest was largely academic. Greenland is enormous -- the world's largest island -- and almost entirely covered in ice. Its population is about 56,000, roughly the size of a midrange college town. It has two operational mines. There are no roads between most settlements. Denmark handles its foreign policy and defense, and sends about $600 million a year in subsidies to keep the place running. For decades, the US got what it needed through basing agreements. Thule Air Base -- now Pituffik Space Base -- has been operating since 1951 as the northernmost US military installation on earth, running missile early warning radar and space surveillance for NORAD.

What changed is the ice. And the minerals underneath it.

The Arctic is warming at roughly four times the global average. Shipping routes that were frozen year-round are now navigable for months at a stretch. The Northern Sea Route along Russia's coast is already handling commercial traffic. The Northwest Passage through Canada's archipelago is opening. And Greenland sits right in the middle of the strategic geometry -- straddling the GIUK Gap where NATO monitors Russian submarines entering the Atlantic, sitting on top of an estimated 36-42 million metric tons of rare earth oxides, potentially the second-largest reserve on earth after China.

The strategic case for deeper US engagement in Greenland is real. Almost nobody serious disputes it. The question has always been method.

## The courtship

The first Trump administration floated the idea of buying Greenland in August 2019. Denmark's prime minister called it "absurd." Trump canceled a state visit. It looked like a one-off ego play.

It wasn't.

After the 2024 election, before he even took office, Trump put it back on the table. In December 2024, he posted on Truth Social that "the ownership and control of Greenland is an absolute necessity" for national security. He appointed PayPal co-founder Ken Howery as ambassador to Denmark. According to TIME, aides say he talked about Greenland constantly in the weeks after the election -- "sometimes offhandedly, sometimes with more insistence, as though it were a deal awaiting the right intermediary."

In early January 2025, Donald Trump Jr. flew to Nuuk with Charlie Kirk and Sergio Gor on Trump's private plane. They landed at 3 AM. They were on the ground for a few hours. There were no substantive meetings. No formal outreach to Greenlandic or Danish officials. The trip produced a photo op and a Truth Social post: "I am hearing the people of Greenland are MAGA." Local media reported the entourage handed out MAGA hats and tried to talk to residents on speakerphone.

A Greenlandic member of parliament called it "staged."

Then it escalated. In January 2025, Trump said he wouldn't rule out military or economic force to acquire Greenland. In March, during the State of the Union, he said the US would get Greenland "one way or the other." That same month, Vance became the first sitting Vice President to visit the territory. In December 2025, Trump appointed Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry as special envoy to Greenland.

Meanwhile, a parallel track was producing actual results. The US reopened a consulate in Nuuk. The Export-Import Bank issued a $120 million letter of interest for the Tanbreez rare earth mine -- the first US overseas mining investment of its kind. American and Danish officials had quietly pressured Tanbreez not to sell to Chinese developers, and it went to a US company instead, reportedly for less money. Greenland's new prime minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, had declared the island "open for business" and specifically wary of Chinese investment. The independence movement was gaining momentum -- a commission was preparing a report for late 2026 -- and the structural logic pointed toward a Greenland that would gradually drift into the US economic orbit anyway.

> The door was open. The US was already walking through it.

## The week it all went wrong

On January 3, 2026, the US military captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in a stunning operation. The next day, Katie Miller -- wife of White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller -- posted an image of Greenland draped in an American flag with the caption "SOON." Trump told The Atlantic: "We do need Greenland, absolutely."

On January 14, Danish Foreign Minister Rasmussen and Greenlandic counterpart Motzfeldt met Vance and Rubio at the White House. They left describing "fundamental disagreement." Trump told reporters: "We really need it. If we don't go in, Russia is going to go in and China is going to go in. And there's not a thing Denmark can do about it."

The next day, European troops started arriving in Greenland. France sent 15 soldiers. Germany sent 13. Norway, Sweden, the UK, the Netherlands, and Finland followed. About 50 personnel total for a Danish-led exercise called "Arctic Endurance." The force was symbolic. The message was not: European NATO allies were deploying to protect a NATO member's territory from the United States.

> For five days, the alliance structure the entire Arctic strategy depends on was fracturing in public. European leaders were treating the United States as a threat to the Arctic rather than a partner in securing it.

Trump's response was tariffs. On January 17, he announced 10% duties on all eight participating countries, effective February 1, rising to 25% by June. The tariffs would apply "until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland." He sent a letter to Norway's prime minister complaining about not receiving the Nobel Peace Prize, adding: "I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace."

Norway's prime minister pointed out that the Nobel Peace Prize is awarded by an independent committee, not the Norwegian government.

The EU called an emergency meeting. Counter-tariffs of up to 108 billion euros were discussed. The Anti-Coercion Instrument -- a retaliatory tool the EU had created but never used -- was on the table for the first time. Sweden's PM: "We will not allow ourselves to be blackmailed." EU foreign policy chief Kallas: "China and Russia must be having a field day." Manfred Weber declared the US-EU trade deal dead.

Even Republicans broke. Tillis called it "beyond stupid." Murkowski said Greenland should be treated "as an ally, not as an asset." Bacon said it would be "the end of his presidency." CNN polled it: 75% of Americans opposed taking control of Greenland. Four percent supported military action.

The ICE Pact -- where the US is building icebreakers with Finland -- was being undermined by tariffs on Finland for participating in a NATO exercise. European leaders were at Davos talking to each other without significant US participation, coordinating exactly the kind of anti-American economic response the hemispheric architecture is designed to prevent.

Then it ended. On January 21, Trump met NATO Secretary General Rutte at the World Economic Forum. Within hours he posted that they had reached "the framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland and, in fact, the entire Arctic Region." He dropped all tariff threats. In a CNBC interview, he called it "pretty much the concept of a deal."

NATO's spokeswoman clarified that Rutte "did not propose any compromise to sovereignty." The framework would focus on "collective efforts" to ensure "Russia and China never gain a foothold -- economically or militarily -- in Greenland." Ole Waever, a professor at the University of Copenhagen, called the framework a "pretend deal." The Dutch PM said he was glad about "de-escalation." Markets surged.

> What actually happened: Trump demanded ownership. Europe refused and threatened hundreds of billions in retaliation across $1.7 trillion in transatlantic trade. Rutte offered a face-saving framework that gave Trump nothing he didn't already have -- collective Arctic security is literally NATO's existing mission -- and let him claim a deal and drop the tariffs before they took effect.

The "concept of a deal" was the concept of the status quo, repackaged.

## What I think this means

I keep coming back to one question: why?

Every strategic objective the administration could possibly have in Greenland -- rare earth access, missile defense, keeping China and Russia out, reducing dependency on Denmark's goodwill -- was already being pursued, quietly and effectively, through normal channels. The consulate was open. The mining money was flowing. The icebreakers were being built with allies. The independence movement was doing the long-term work of loosening Greenland from Copenhagen. The base at Pituffik was operating under treaty-guaranteed access.

All of that was working. None of it required threatening to invade a NATO ally.

The best explanation I can come up with is that two different logics are operating simultaneously and they keep colliding.

There's the structural logic -- the convergent incentives that I've been tracing across the series. Finland needs icebreaker contracts. Canada needs Arctic relevance. The US needs ships it can't build. Greenland needs investment that isn't Chinese. Those incentives don't change because of a five-day tariff tantrum. They didn't change. The ICE Pact is still moving. The mineral cooperation is still there. The independence trajectory hasn't reversed. The architecture held.

Then there's the executive logic, which operates like a real estate developer's theory of power. Leases can be revoked. Treaties can be renegotiated. Partnership agreements depend on the other side's continued goodwill. Only ownership provides unconditional control. That logic produces demands for "Complete and Total purchase" when the strategic situation calls for partnership agreements and patient structural alignment.

Five days of chaos. An alliance nearly fractured. European leaders treating the United States as a threat to the Arctic rather than a partner in securing it. All for a "concept of a deal" that contained nothing new.

The structural incentives survived it. They'll probably survive the next one too. But the episode showed something important: the system depends on allied cooperation, and the executive can damage that cooperation faster than institutions can repair it.

> The roof held. Now we know where it leaks.
