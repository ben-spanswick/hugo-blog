**Private torrenting pipeline behind a VPN, with automatic sorting and renaming**

## The Problem: Secure, Hassle-Free Media Management

Anyone who runs a self-hosted media server knows the pain of keeping everything organized, private, and automated. Torrents are great for grabbing contentâ€”but exposing your real IP, sorting files, or manually managing downloads? Not so great.

My goal: Build a system where **TV shows, movies, and audiobooks** download automatically, sort themselves, are always behind a VPN (with a kill switch!), and end up right where Jellyfin or Audiobookshelf expect themâ€”on my Unraid NAS.

Hereâ€™s how I did it, the roadblocks I hit, and what Iâ€™d do differently.

## The Stack: Overview

* **Gluetun**: Containerized VPN with built-in kill switch for all torrent traffic
* **qBittorrent**: The torrent client, running *inside* the Gluetun network for privacy
* **Sonarr & Radarr**: TV/movie automation and renaming
* **Audiobookshelf**: For managing and streaming audiobooks
* **Unraid NAS**: Network storage for media libraries
* **Docker Compose**: Orchestrating it all

## Implementation: Step by Step

### 1. Gluetun: VPN and Kill Switch

**Why Gluetun?**
Traditional VPN clients can leak traffic or break when the connection drops. Gluetun is a Docker container that proxies *all* network traffic of connected containersâ€”no IP leaks, ever.

* VPN provider: Private Internet Access (PIA), NordVPN, etc.
* Runs as its own service in Docker Compose
* qBittorrent, Sonarr, and Radarr use Gluetunâ€™s network stack for 100% traffic routing

**Sample Compose Block:**

```yaml
services:
  gluetun:
    image: qmcgaw/gluetun:latest
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN
    environment:
      - VPN_SERVICE_PROVIDER=private internet access
      - OPENVPN_USER=<REDACTED>
      - OPENVPN_PASSWORD=<REDACTED>
      - SERVER_COUNTRIES=United States
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"  # qBittorrent Web UI
      - "8989:8989"  # Sonarr
      - "7878:7878"  # Radarr
    volumes:
      - ./gluetun:/gluetun
```

---

### 2. qBittorrent: The Engine

* Runs in the same network as Gluetun (`network_mode: service:gluetun`)
* Only accessible if VPN is up (kill switch)
* Downloads split into separate folders for TV, Movies, and Audiobooks
* Ports mapped through Gluetun (see above)

**Compose Block:**

```yaml
  qbittorrent:
    image: linuxserver/qbittorrent
    depends_on:
      - gluetun
    network_mode: "service:gluetun"
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=America/New_York
      - WEBUI_PORT=8080
    volumes:
      - /mnt/r430/media/torrents:/downloads
      - ./qbittorrent/config:/config
    restart: unless-stopped
```

---

### 3. Sonarr & Radarr: Automation & Renaming

* Monitor trackers for new TV episodes/movies
* Add torrents to qBittorrent via API
* Move and rename downloads to final folders (`/mnt/r430/media/tv`, `/mnt/r430/media/movies`)

**Compose Blocks:**

```yaml
  sonarr:
    image: linuxserver/sonarr
    network_mode: "service:gluetun"
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=America/New_York
    volumes:
      - /mnt/r430/media/tv:/tv
      - /mnt/r430/media/torrents:/downloads
      - ./sonarr/config:/config
    restart: unless-stopped

  radarr:
    image: linuxserver/radarr
    network_mode: "service:gluetun"
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=America/New_York
    volumes:
      - /mnt/r430/media/movies:/movies
      - /mnt/r430/media/torrents:/downloads
      - ./radarr/config:/config
    restart: unless-stopped
```

### 4. Audiobookshelf: Private Audible Alternative

* Pointed directly to `/mnt/r430/media/audiobooks` and `/mnt/r430/media/ebooks`
* Runs in its own Docker container (doesnâ€™t need VPN)
* Accessible via Traefik reverse proxy and secured with Authelia

**Compose Block:**

```yaml
  audiobookshelf:
    image: ghcr.io/advplyr/audiobookshelf:latest
    container_name: audiobookshelf
    ports:
      - "13378:80"
    environment:
      - TZ=America/New_York
    volumes:
      - /mnt/r430/media/audiobooks:/audiobooks
      - /mnt/r430/media/ebooks:/ebooks
      - ./audiobookshelf/config:/config
      - ./audiobookshelf/metadata:/metadata
    restart: unless-stopped
```

---

### 5. Unraid NAS: The Central Media Hub

* All media folders are network shares on Unraid (`/mnt/r430/media/...`)
* Docker hosts mount these shares directly (CIFS/NFS)
* Keeps everything available to Jellyfin, Audiobookshelf, Paperless, etc.

---

## Troubles & Gotchas

* **VPN Flakiness:** Make sure your credentials donâ€™t expire and you choose reliable endpoints (test speed!).
* **Permissions Hell:** All containers should run as the same user/group (PUID/PGID), or file moves will break.
* **Network Segmentation:** VLANs and Docker networking can cause service discovery issuesâ€”map only the ports you need!
* **Automation Gone Wild:** Use good indexers and filters in Sonarr/Radarr or youâ€™ll wake up with terabytes of junk.
* **Disk Space:** Monitor your NAS spaceâ€”automated downloads fill up fast!

---

## Lessons Learned

* **All traffic must go through Gluetun.** Any port mapped directly to the host bypasses the VPN. Be careful with Docker Compose syntax.
* **Use Unraidâ€™s built-in share management** to keep file permissions sane and make it easy to back up or move libraries.
* **Keep your Compose files in Git.** If you break something, you can always revert.
* **Test restores, not just backups.**

## Final Thoughts

This setup turned my media workflow from chaos into order. Now, *everything*â€”from the moment a show is released to when it appears in my media libraryâ€”is automated, safe, and totally private.

If youâ€™re self-hosting and tired of manual downloads or worrying about privacy, this Gluetun-centric pipeline is a game-changer.
