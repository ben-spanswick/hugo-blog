        <description>&lt;img src="http://192.168.100.63:1313/img/claude4/header.png" alt="Featured image of post 24 Hours with Claude 4: When the Hype Actually Delivers" /&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;ai-summary&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#ai-summary&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;AI Summary
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Superior Reasoning:&lt;/strong&gt; Claude 4 excels at complex coding and architectural tasks, significantly outperforming previous versions and competitors like GPT-4.1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Debugging Weakness:&lt;/strong&gt; Its strength in providing definitive answers becomes a weakness in debugging. It offers solutions but doesn&amp;rsquo;t collaborate on troubleshooting like Claude 3.7.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creative Depth:&lt;/strong&gt; The model demonstrates a deeper level of creative rewriting, reconstructing content from the ground up rather than making superficial changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optimal Workflow:&lt;/strong&gt; The best approach involves a multi-tool setup: Claude 4 for core development, Claude 3.7 for collaborative debugging, and GPT-4o for casual brainstorming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night, I fed Claude 4 a bug that had been mocking me for three weeks. The kind of feature that works perfectly until it doesn&amp;rsquo;t, then breaks in ways that make you question your life choices. Claude 3.7 had poked at it like a confused mechanic, suggesting the same fixes in different orders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Claude 4 dissected it in two minutes. Clean. Surgical. Done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That moment crystallized something I&amp;rsquo;d been sensing all day: this isn&amp;rsquo;t just another version bump with marketing copy about &amp;ldquo;enhanced capabilities.&amp;rdquo; We&amp;rsquo;re talking about a genuine architectural shift in how these systems think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-max-plan-laboratory&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#the-max-plan-laboratory&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Max Plan Laboratory
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been running both engines—Opus through Claude Code for the heavy lifting, Sonnet in the web interface for everything else. I&amp;rsquo;m a Max plan subscriber with three AI subscriptions running in parallel because, apparently, I enjoy paying for the privilege of comparing chatbots like wine vintages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Claude 4 makes o3 feel sluggish by comparison. Against GPT-4.1, it demolishes complex reasoning tasks and multi-step coding challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still grab GPT-4o for casual conversations—it has that easy rapport thing nailed - but when the work gets serious, Claude 4 owns the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coding improvements aren&amp;rsquo;t subtle. With 3.7, I&amp;rsquo;d feed it a problem and watch it think out loud, trying different approaches, sometimes circling back to earlier mistakes. Claude 4 operates more like that senior developer who&amp;rsquo;s seen this exact problem seventeen times before. No theatrics. Just solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;binary-thinking-blues&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#binary-thinking-blues&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Binary Thinking Blues
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;But experience has taught me to poke at the edges, to find where the magic breaks down. Claude 4&amp;rsquo;s strength becomes its weakness in debugging scenarios. It either knows the answer or it doesn&amp;rsquo;t. Binary. Definitive. Sometimes unhelpfully final.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.7 would troubleshoot with you. It would break problems down, try variations, and explore dead ends until something clicked. That collaborative debugging energy made it feel like a persistent partner rather than an oracle. Claude 4 delivers more accurate answers when it has them, but when it hits a wall, it just&amp;hellip; stops. No alternatives. No exploration. Conversation over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For core architecture work, this decisiveness is perfect. For those 2 AM debugging sessions when nothing makes sense and you need someone to think through the impossible with you? &lt;em&gt;Keep 3.7 bookmarked.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;creative-surgery&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#creative-surgery&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Creative Surgery
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The creative writing changes caught me sideways. It&amp;rsquo;s not just better output - it&amp;rsquo;s a fundamentally different response to feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tell 3.7 to &amp;ldquo;make this less casual,&amp;rdquo; and you&amp;rsquo;d get surface-level adjustments. Same structure underneath, different word choices on top. It was like spray-painting over rust instead of replacing the metal. Claude 4 actually reconstructs. Ask for tone changes, and it reconsiders the entire approach, rebuilding from different foundations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3.7 course-corrects while walking. Claude 4 stops, consults the map, and chooses a completely different route.&lt;/em&gt; This same architectural thinking that makes debugging feel abrupt makes creative iteration feel genuinely collaborative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;context-window-wizardry&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#context-window-wizardry&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Context Window Wizardry
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone&amp;rsquo;s obsessing over the 200k token context window. &amp;ldquo;How can you compete with million-token windows?&amp;rdquo; they ask, brandishing their context length like a measuring contest at a developer conference. But working with Claude 4, that limitation feels&amp;hellip; irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something sophisticated is happening under the hood. The system handles complex, multi-part conversations without the typical degradation you&amp;rsquo;d expect from a smaller window. Either they&amp;rsquo;ve cracked some impressive compression techniques or they&amp;rsquo;re doing something clever with attention mechanisms that makes every token count double.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever the architecture, it works. I haven&amp;rsquo;t hit the ceiling in practical use, even during extended coding sessions with massive codebases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;skip-the-omni-features&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#skip-the-omni-features&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Skip the Omni Features
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quick sidebar:&lt;/strong&gt; the multimodal capabilities are forgettable. If you need vision or voice interactions, stick with GPT-4o. Claude 4&amp;rsquo;s strength lives in text-based reasoning and code generation. Don&amp;rsquo;t get distracted by the omni features - they feel tacked on rather than thoughtfully integrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;workflow-archaeology&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#workflow-archaeology&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Workflow Archaeology
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After cycling through dozens of AI tools, I&amp;rsquo;m settling into something that feels sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Claude 4:&lt;/strong&gt; Handles the foundational work - system design, complex implementations, anything requiring sustained reasoning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Claude 3.7:&lt;/strong&gt; My go-to for collaborative debugging when the path forward is unclear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GPT-4o:&lt;/strong&gt; Stays in the rotation for quick brainstorming and casual interactions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not the streamlined, single-tool future we were promised, but complexity often demands specialized solutions. The Linux world figured this out decades ago: use the best tool for each job and compose them intelligently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;actually-worth-the-upgrade&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#actually-worth-the-upgrade&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Actually Worth the Upgrade
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Claude 4 represents something I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen in AI development lately: genuine capability expansion rather than just parameter optimization. It&amp;rsquo;s solving categories of problems that previously required workarounds or multiple tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The binary thinking limitation is real, but understanding it transforms frustration into strategic tool selection. Know when to switch. Know what each system does best. Work with the grain of the technology instead of against it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty-four hours in, and I&amp;rsquo;m convinced this isn&amp;rsquo;t just iterative improvement. Something fundamental shifted in how these systems process and respond to complex requirements. The upgrade path finally feels worth taking.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Real Problem with AI Today? Nobody Knows What Works Tomorrow</title>

        <description>&lt;img src="http://192.168.100.63:1313/img/tintinconfused.png" alt="Featured image of post The Real Problem with AI Today? Nobody Knows What Works Tomorrow" /&gt;&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-real-problem-with-ai-today-nobody-knows-what-works-tomorrow&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#the-real-problem-with-ai-today-nobody-knows-what-works-tomorrow&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Real Problem with AI Today? Nobody Knows What Works Tomorrow
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been living in AI tools for the past year. Multiple subscriptions, endless experiments, daily workflows built around these systems. And I&amp;rsquo;m starting to think we&amp;rsquo;re all participating in the world&amp;rsquo;s most expensive beta test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s how my mornings go: Yesterday&amp;rsquo;s perfectly functioning ChatGPT woke up stupid. The code that was flowing like water twelve hours ago now reads like it was written by someone who just discovered what a semicolon is. So I jump to Claude – except artifacts decided to take a vacation. Fine, Gemini it is. Works brilliantly. For exactly one day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we reset the whole circus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-great-instability-crisis&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#the-great-instability-crisis&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Great Instability Crisis
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Browse any AI community and you&amp;rsquo;ll witness a fascinating phenomenon. Half the posts are people convinced their AI tool had a lobotomy overnight. The other half are discovering that some random update made their previously useless tool suddenly brilliant. It&amp;rsquo;s technological whiplash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The explanations we get are beautifully meaningless. &amp;ldquo;Backend optimizations.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Model improvements.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Training updates.&amp;rdquo; Might as well say &amp;ldquo;we changed some stuff&amp;rdquo; and call it a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here&amp;rsquo;s what kills me – I&amp;rsquo;m paying premium prices for tools that fundamentally change their behavior without warning. Imagine if Microsoft Word randomly decided that today it only writes in iambic pentameter. That&amp;rsquo;s the level of consistency we&amp;rsquo;re dealing with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;racing-toward-mediocrity&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#racing-toward-mediocrity&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Racing Toward Mediocrity
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The competition between AI companies has created this bizarre dynamic where everyone&amp;rsquo;s sprinting to release features that barely work. OpenAI sees Claude&amp;rsquo;s artifacts and panics. Google watches GitHub Copilot and scrambles. Everyone&amp;rsquo;s so busy keeping up with everyone else that nobody&amp;rsquo;s actually finishing anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s coding assistant launch? It had all the polish of a middle school science project. But hey, Claude had one, so out it goes. Ship now, fix later – except &amp;ldquo;later&amp;rdquo; never really arrives because there&amp;rsquo;s always another half-baked feature to rush out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-stability-manifesto&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#the-stability-manifesto&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Stability Manifesto
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me paint you a picture of what we actually need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Version Dichotomy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Linux world figured this out decades ago. You want cutting-edge chaos? Here&amp;rsquo;s your rolling release. You want to actually get work done? Here&amp;rsquo;s Debian Stable, unchanged since the dawn of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give me ChatGPT-Stable that updates quarterly with actual testing. Let the adrenaline junkies play with ChatGPT-Edge where every refresh is a new adventure. I&amp;rsquo;ll take boring reliability over exciting uncertainty every single time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purpose-Built Models&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This obsession with omni-models needs to die. I don&amp;rsquo;t need my code assistant to write poetry. I don&amp;rsquo;t need my creative writing tool to debug Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anthropic almost gets this with their Opus/Sonnet/Haiku split, but even they&amp;rsquo;re muddying the waters. OpenAI? Their model naming looks like someone got drunk with a label maker. GPT-4, o1, o3 (apparently o2 was too mainstream), various &amp;ldquo;turbo&amp;rdquo; versions that may or may not exist anymore, and enough &amp;ldquo;mini&amp;rdquo; variants to stock a convenience store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pick. A. Lane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Naming That Doesn&amp;rsquo;t Require a Decoder Ring&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I challenge anyone to explain OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s naming convention without sounding like they&amp;rsquo;re reading from a random number generator. We&amp;rsquo;ve transcended confusion and entered the realm of performance art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-productivity-paradox&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#the-productivity-paradox&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Productivity Paradox
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every workflow disruption costs me 20-30 minutes minimum. Not just the switching – the testing, the adapting to different interfaces, the rewriting prompts that worked yesterday but fail today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scale that across millions of users. We&amp;rsquo;re hemorrhaging productivity in the name of progress. The tools designed to make us more efficient are becoming the biggest efficiency drains in our workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve started keeping a spreadsheet of which model works best for which task on which day. That&amp;rsquo;s insane. I&amp;rsquo;m doing data analysis just to figure out which AI can do data analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;an-alternative-universe&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#an-alternative-universe&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;An Alternative Universe
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Picture this: You wake up knowing exactly how your AI tools will behave. Your carefully crafted prompts work the same way they did yesterday. The model that excels at code generation still excels at code generation. Revolutionary concept, I know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some radical proposals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stability Contracts&lt;/strong&gt;: Guarantee model behavior for minimum 90-day periods. Not &amp;ldquo;mostly the same with minor tweaks.&amp;rdquo; Identical. Frozen. Immutable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real-World Beta Testing&lt;/strong&gt;: Stop testing on production. Those &amp;ldquo;minor updates&amp;rdquo; that break everything? Maybe catch those before inflicting them on paying customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transparent Change Logs&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;ldquo;We reduced latency by 50ms but code generation accuracy dropped 3% in recursive functions&amp;rdquo; beats &amp;ldquo;performance improvements&amp;rdquo; every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feature Moratorium&lt;/strong&gt;: Declare a six-month freeze on new features. Fix what exists. Make it bulletproof. Then, and only then, add the next shiny thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-excellence-of-mundane-consistency&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#the-excellence-of-mundane-consistency&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Excellence of Mundane Consistency
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve confused innovation with instability. The most innovative thing any AI company could do right now is&amp;hellip; nothing. Stop touching things. Let them work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t need my AI assistant to be marginally smarter next week if it means it might be catastrophically dumber instead. I need it to be boringly, predictably, reliably competent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market leader won&amp;rsquo;t be whoever scores 0.5% higher on some benchmark nobody understands. It&amp;rsquo;ll be whoever first realizes that professionals need professional tools – tools that show up ready to work every single day, not tools that require a morning diagnostic to determine today&amp;rsquo;s personality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-reckoning&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#the-reckoning&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Reckoning
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the truth these companies need to hear: Your users aren&amp;rsquo;t beta testers. We&amp;rsquo;re not excited by surprise feature drops that break our workflows. We&amp;rsquo;re not impressed by rush-released features that sort of work sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re exhausted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AI revolution promised to augment human capability. Instead, we&amp;rsquo;re spending our augmented capability figuring out why our augmentation tools stopped working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;rsquo;s my challenge to the AI giants: Be brave enough to be boring. Be innovative enough to be stable. Be competitive by being consistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because right now, the most disruptive thing in AI would be reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are you thriving in this chaos, or are you also maintaining spreadsheets to track which AI is having a good day?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
