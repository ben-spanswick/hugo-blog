        <description>&lt;img src="http://192.168.100.63:1313/img/head/techdebt.png" alt="Featured image of post How to Scale Your Data Science Team Without Everything Falling Apart" /&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;ai-summary&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#ai-summary&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;AI Summary
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communication complexity explodes exponentially as teams grow, creating coordination nightmares that kill productivity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Traditional functional silos (separate data engineering, modeling, deployment teams) create bottlenecks that slow everything down&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;End-to-end squad structures and platform thinking are the antidotes to scaling chaos&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strategic technical debt management and tiered governance prevent bureaucracy from strangling innovation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-curse-of-success&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#the-curse-of-success&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Curse of Success
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You start with 2 analysts crushing it in whatever corner of the office they can find. Leadership notices the impact. Budget flows. You hire more people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two years later? You&amp;rsquo;re managing 20+ data scientists across two teams, and somehow everything takes longer than when you had that scrappy duo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve lived this nightmare twice - once scaling a cross-functional intelligence team that mixed analysts, data scientists, and case officers, and most recently taking my current utility from those original 2 analysts to two teams totaling 20+ data scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The math is unforgiving, but the strategy can save you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-death-spiral-mathematics&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#the-death-spiral-mathematics&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Death Spiral Mathematics
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brutal reality of team growth isn&amp;rsquo;t just about headcount - it&amp;rsquo;s about connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 people create 10 possible communication pathways. Manageable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15 people create 105 connections. Getting complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20 people create 190 potential relationships. This is where good teams start to strain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What kills you isn&amp;rsquo;t the people - it&amp;rsquo;s the exponential complexity of keeping everyone aligned. In the intelligence community, we had the added complexity of different clearance levels creating natural silos. In utilities, it&amp;rsquo;s the technical specializations that create understanding gaps between teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;where-traditional-scaling-goes-wrong&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#where-traditional-scaling-goes-wrong&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Where Traditional Scaling Goes Wrong
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Functional Silos Build Themselves&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The natural instinct is to organize by skill: data engineers here, modelers there, deployment specialists over there. Clean org chart, clear responsibilities, total disaster for delivery speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first attempt at scaling followed this playbook. Six months later, a simple model deployment required coordinating across three teams, two managers, and a project manager just to get everyone in the same room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical Debt Compound Interest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Year 1: &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ll refactor this when we have time&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Year 2: &amp;ldquo;New hires can&amp;rsquo;t understand our legacy code&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Year 3: &amp;ldquo;It takes two sprints to add a single feature because nothing connects properly&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;rsquo;t theoretical - I&amp;rsquo;ve inherited codebases where changing a single parameter required touching 15 different files because nobody had time to build proper abstractions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-actually-works&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#what-actually-works&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What Actually Works
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Squad Structure Over Functional Teams&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pivot that changed everything: 4-7 person squads that own problems end-to-end rather than handoffs between specialized teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each squad includes the full stack - someone who understands data engineering, modeling, deployment, and business context. Not everyone needs to be expert in everything, but someone in the squad needs to understand each piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference in deployment speed was immediate and dramatic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Platform Thinking Changes the Game&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individual brilliance doesn&amp;rsquo;t scale. Platform leverage does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of every data scientist building their own infrastructure, we invested heavily in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feature stores that everyone uses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One-click deployment pipelines that handle 90% of common use cases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Self-service analytics tools that reduce ad-hoc requests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six months of platform investment unlocked productivity gains that compounded as we added more people. New hires became productive in weeks instead of months because the infrastructure already existed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategic Technical Debt Management&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all technical debt is created equal. We maintain a debt registry that tracks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What the debt is&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What it costs us in velocity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What it would take to fix&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Business impact if left alone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we allocate 20% of sprint capacity to paying down the expensive stuff first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach cut our production incidents by nearly half while actually increasing feature velocity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-scaling-stages-ive-observed&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#the-scaling-stages-ive-observed&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Scaling Stages I&amp;rsquo;ve Observed
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage 1: The Scrappy Team (2-8 people)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone does everything. Context switching is constant but manageable. Proving value is the primary objective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This stage feels chaotic but moves fast. Don&amp;rsquo;t try to over-optimize here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage 2: Growing Pains (8-20 people)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where most teams either figure it out or die slowly. You need process without killing speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key insight: You can&amp;rsquo;t preserve what made the small team great - you have to evolve into what works at the new scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage 3: Scaled Function (20+ people)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Platform thinking becomes essential. Real governance matters. Coordination becomes a skill unto itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building my current utility team from 2 to 20+ across two specialized teams, I had to consciously introduce Stage 2 processes at the right inflection points. It felt like slowing down to speed up, but it prevented the chaos I&amp;rsquo;d seen derail other scaling efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;metrics-that-actually-matter&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#metrics-that-actually-matter&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Metrics That Actually Matter
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditional metrics miss the point. Track these instead:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time from idea to production&lt;/strong&gt; - Should stay flat or improve as you scale&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deployment frequency&lt;/strong&gt; - How often you actually ship working solutions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Onboarding time&lt;/strong&gt; - How fast new people become productive contributors&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintenance overhead&lt;/strong&gt; - Percentage of time keeping things running versus building new capability&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cross-team collaboration&lt;/strong&gt; - Are people working together or retreating into silos?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-uncomfortable-evolution&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#the-uncomfortable-evolution&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Uncomfortable Evolution
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The things that make small teams effective become liabilities at scale:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minimal process becomes coordination chaos. Informal communication becomes information silos. Everyone doing everything becomes nobody owning anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the answer isn&amp;rsquo;t bureaucracy - it&amp;rsquo;s intentional evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The principles stay constant: speed, ownership, experimentation, measurable impact. The implementation changes: structure that enables rather than constrains, platforms that amplify individual contributions, teams that preserve autonomy within aligned direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-real-challenge&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#the-real-challenge&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Real Challenge
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most data science teams that scale successfully don&amp;rsquo;t preserve what they had - they evolve into what they need to become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal isn&amp;rsquo;t staying small. It&amp;rsquo;s staying effective at whatever size your business demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the alternative is becoming one of those expensive teams that produces impressive slide decks and minimal business impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After scaling teams in both intelligence and utility contexts, the pattern is clear: scaling isn&amp;rsquo;t about doing more of the same thing. It&amp;rsquo;s about doing fundamentally different things that work at the new scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The math doesn&amp;rsquo;t lie - but neither does intentional strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why Hiring Only Senior Data Scientists Will Destroy Your Team</title>
        <link>http://192.168.100.63:1313/datascience/genius/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 20 Nov 2024 14:30:00 -0400</pubDate>

        <description>&lt;img src="http://192.168.100.63:1313/img/head/genius.png" alt="Featured image of post Why Hiring Only Senior Data Scientists Will Destroy Your Team" /&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;ai-summary&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#ai-summary&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;AI Summary
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teams stacked with only senior-level talent often prioritize technical complexity over practical solutions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Junior team members and interns frequently approach problems without the constraints of &amp;ldquo;how it&amp;rsquo;s always been done&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The cost/value tradeoff of senior-heavy teams creates budget constraints that limit team growth and experimentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ego-driven technical discussions can overshadow actual problem-solving when everyone feels they need to prove their expertise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-vegetation-management-analysis-that-taught-me-everything&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#the-vegetation-management-analysis-that-taught-me-everything&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Vegetation Management Analysis That Taught Me Everything
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our COO asked for a retrospective analysis of how our vegetation management program was performing under weather-normalized conditions. Simple request, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not when you&amp;rsquo;re a team that spends most of its time doing deep weather analytics work. We dive into storm impact modeling, complex outage correlations, sophisticated vegetation management algorithms. Our default mode is finding the most technically robust solution to every problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So naturally, when tasked with this retrospective, our gut reaction was to build something complex. Zero hour actuals, fine-grain resolution, multi-layered weather normalization models. The kind of analysis that would make meteorologists proud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team was already sketching out approaches that would take months to implement properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then our summer intern spoke up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What if we just pulled all the weather station data at 5-minute intervals and applied a transformation that aligns with the Beaufort scale?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The room went quiet. Not because it was wrong, but because it was so obviously right that none of us had thought of it. We&amp;rsquo;d been so conditioned to solve complex problems with complex solutions that we&amp;rsquo;d missed the straightforward approach sitting right there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her method worked perfectly for what we actually needed to deliver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This moment crystallized something I&amp;rsquo;d been noticing throughout my decade of building and leading data science teams: our obsession with hiring only the most technically advanced people was creating more problems than it solved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-senior-trap-thats-bankrupting-your-budget&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#the-senior-trap-thats-bankrupting-your-budget&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Senior Trap That&amp;rsquo;s Bankrupting Your Budget
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the uncomfortable math that most data science leaders don&amp;rsquo;t want to face: a team of five senior data scientists costs roughly the same as a team of twelve mixed-level contributors. But which team actually delivers more value?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After leading teams through both configurations, the answer surprised me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The All-Senior Team Reality&lt;/strong&gt;
Every problem becomes a technical showcase. Simple analyses get over-engineered because everyone needs to demonstrate their expertise. What should be a straightforward regression becomes an ensemble of gradient boosting models with hyperparameter optimization and cross-validation schemes that would make academic reviewers weep with joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, you&amp;rsquo;re burning through budget at an alarming rate while moving slowly on basic deliverables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Mixed-Level Team Advantage&lt;/strong&gt;
Junior people ask &amp;ldquo;why are we doing it this way?&amp;rdquo; Senior people know how to execute when complexity is actually needed. Mid-level contributors bridge the gap and keep projects moving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result? Faster iteration, more practical solutions, and budget left over for the tools and infrastructure that actually matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;when-ego-kills-solutions&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#when-ego-kills-solutions&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;When Ego Kills Solutions
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early in my career, I made the mistake of building a team where everyone felt they needed to prove they belonged in the room. PhD vs. industry experience. Deep learning vs. traditional statistics. Python vs. R debates that consumed entire meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technical discussions weren&amp;rsquo;t about finding the best solution - they were about demonstrating individual expertise. Everyone was so busy puffing out their chest that we lost sight of what we were actually trying to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moment your team meetings become intellectual competitions instead of collaborative problem-solving sessions, you&amp;rsquo;ve lost the plot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned this lesson when we spent three weeks debating the optimal architecture for a recommendation system while our business stakeholders were getting frustrated with basic reporting delays. We had brilliant people solving the wrong problems in the most complex ways possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-fresh-eyes-factor&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#the-fresh-eyes-factor&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Fresh Eyes Factor
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s something powerful about approaching a problem without the accumulated assumptions of experience. Junior team members haven&amp;rsquo;t learned what&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;impossible&amp;rdquo; yet. They haven&amp;rsquo;t internalized the industry conventional wisdom that might be outdated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Pattern I Keep Seeing&lt;/strong&gt;
Senior person: &amp;ldquo;This is how we&amp;rsquo;ve always handled time series forecasting in utilities&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;
Junior person: &amp;ldquo;What if we treated this like a recommendation problem instead?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the junior person is wrong. But sometimes they&amp;rsquo;re seeing something the rest of us missed because we were too focused on the &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; way to do things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Questions That Change Everything&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Why can&amp;rsquo;t we just use the existing weather data?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;What if we simplified this model instead of making it more complex?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Do we actually need real-time predictions, or would daily be sufficient?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These aren&amp;rsquo;t questions that come from inexperience. They come from not being constrained by how things have always been done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-hidden-costs-of-senior-heavy-teams&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#the-hidden-costs-of-senior-heavy-teams&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Hidden Costs of Senior-Heavy Teams
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Budget Reality Check&lt;/strong&gt;
Five senior data scientists at market rate: $1.2M+ annually in salary alone
Mixed team of two seniors, four mid-level, six juniors: roughly the same cost with double the capacity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Innovation Bottleneck&lt;/strong&gt;
When everyone on the team is a domain expert, you get groupthink. Everyone approaches problems from similar angles because they&amp;rsquo;ve all learned the same &amp;ldquo;best practices.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knowledge Transfer Problem&lt;/strong&gt;
Senior-heavy teams often struggle with documentation and knowledge sharing because everyone assumes everyone else already knows the fundamentals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Client Interface Issues&lt;/strong&gt;
Sometimes you need someone who can explain technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders without drowning them in jargon. Junior team members are often better at this because they remember what it was like to not understand these concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;building-teams-that-actually-work&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#building-teams-that-actually-work&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Building Teams That Actually Work
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The 40-40-20 Rule&lt;/strong&gt;
Roughly 40% mid-level contributors who can execute reliably, 40% junior talent who bring fresh perspectives and handle routine work, 20% senior experts who tackle the genuinely complex problems and provide technical leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;rsquo;t about cutting costs - it&amp;rsquo;s about optimizing for actual output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psychological Safety Over Technical Prowess&lt;/strong&gt;
The best data science teams I&amp;rsquo;ve built prioritize asking good questions over having all the answers. When junior team members feel safe proposing simple solutions, you often discover that simple solutions work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project Rotation Strategy&lt;/strong&gt;
Give junior people ownership of complete problems, not just implementation tasks. Let them propose approaches, even if you know a more sophisticated method exists. Sometimes their approach works better. When it doesn&amp;rsquo;t, the learning experience is valuable for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-transformation-that-actually-matters&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#the-transformation-that-actually-matters&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Transformation That Actually Matters
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After restructuring my teams with this mixed-level approach, something interesting happened. The senior people started enjoying their work more. Instead of being pulled into every routine analysis, they could focus on genuinely challenging problems. Instead of proving their expertise in meetings, they were mentoring and enabling others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The junior people grew faster because they had real ownership and could see the impact of their work. The mid-level contributors became force multipliers who could translate between technical depth and practical execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Success Looks Like&lt;/strong&gt;
Projects move faster because not everything needs to be technically perfect. Budget goes further because you&amp;rsquo;re not paying senior rates for routine work. Innovation increases because diverse perspectives challenge assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, solutions get simpler and more maintainable because you have people asking &amp;ldquo;do we really need all this complexity?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-leadership-shift&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#the-leadership-shift&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Leadership Shift
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leading a mixed-level data science team requires different skills than managing a group of senior experts. You&amp;rsquo;re not just coordinating technical work - you&amp;rsquo;re developing talent, managing different learning curves, and creating an environment where diverse experience levels can contribute effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The payoff is teams that are more resilient, more innovative, and more sustainable than groups built purely on technical credentials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Question That Changes Everything&lt;/strong&gt;
Instead of asking &amp;ldquo;who&amp;rsquo;s the smartest person we can hire?&amp;rdquo; start asking &amp;ldquo;what mix of perspectives and experience levels will solve problems most effectively?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your budget, your timelines, and your actual business outcomes will thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal isn&amp;rsquo;t to avoid hiring brilliant people. It&amp;rsquo;s to build teams where brilliance can flourish alongside fresh thinking, practical execution, and sustainable growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the best solution comes from the person who doesn&amp;rsquo;t know enough to realize it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t work.&lt;/p&gt;
