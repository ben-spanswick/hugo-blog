        <description>&lt;img src="http://192.168.100.63:1313/img/head/kids.png" alt="Featured image of post What My 1 and 4-Year-Olds Taught Me About Leading Data Teams" /&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;ai-summary&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#ai-summary&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;AI Summary
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parenting young children reveals that effective leadership prioritizes understanding over expertise and creates psychological safety for innovation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most powerful leadership tool is genuine curiosity - asking &amp;ldquo;why&amp;rdquo; like a 4-year-old uncovers breakthrough solutions hidden beneath assumptions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building team capability through shared learning creates stronger, more resilient organizations than relying on external expertise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating buffer zones between organizational chaos and team execution requires the same patience and consistency needed in parenting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-accidental-leadership-school&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#the-accidental-leadership-school&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Accidental Leadership School
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I thought I had leadership figured out. Read all the right books, attended the workshops, earned my MS, managed data science teams at a large utility for years. Then I became a dad and realized I knew absolutely nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My 1-year-old daughter and 4-year-old son don&amp;rsquo;t care about my degrees or how many machine learning models my teams have deployed. They just want me to understand them, be curious with them, and not lose my mind when things go sideways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out, that&amp;rsquo;s exactly what my data science teams needed too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After four years of fumbling through both parenting and leadership simultaneously, I&amp;rsquo;ve discovered that toddlers make surprisingly good leadership coaches. They&amp;rsquo;ve completely changed how I think about empathy, curiosity, and creating safe spaces for people to grow - especially when you&amp;rsquo;re trying to shield your teams from the chaos swirling around the C-suite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;actually-listen-before-you-try-to-fix-everything&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#actually-listen-before-you-try-to-fix-everything&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Actually Listen Before You Try to Fix Everything
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;My 1-year-old can&amp;rsquo;t tell me what&amp;rsquo;s wrong when she&amp;rsquo;s upset. She just cries. So I&amp;rsquo;ve become a detective - is she hungry? Tired? Frustrated that she can&amp;rsquo;t reach her toy? I have to put aside whatever I was doing and really pay attention to understand what she needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This completely changed how I handle team problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before kids: Someone comes to me with an issue about model performance, I immediately start debugging the algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After kids: I force myself to understand first, solve second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of jumping to technical solutions, I started asking things like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Help me understand what you&amp;rsquo;re experiencing day-to-day with this model&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s the most frustrating part of this deployment process?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Walk me through how this data pipeline failure impacts your work&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One machine learning engineer came to me complaining about &amp;ldquo;drift in our energy forecasting models.&amp;rdquo; My old approach would have been to immediately dive into retraining strategies and feature engineering. Instead, I asked her to help me understand what she was experiencing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real issue wasn&amp;rsquo;t model drift - it was that constant organizational restructuring meant she never knew if her project would still exist next quarter. She couldn&amp;rsquo;t focus on the technical work because she was stressed about job security. Completely different problem, completely different solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now when senior leadership announces another strategic pivot, I spend more time understanding how my team is processing the change than I do diving into the technical implications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ask-why-like-your-job-depends-on-it&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#ask-why-like-your-job-depends-on-it&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Ask &amp;ldquo;Why&amp;rdquo; Like Your Job Depends on It
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;My 4-year-old asks &amp;ldquo;why&amp;rdquo; about everything. And I mean everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Why is the sky blue?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Why do cars have wheels?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Why do we need to eat vegetables?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s exhausting, but it&amp;rsquo;s also brilliant. He doesn&amp;rsquo;t accept &amp;ldquo;that&amp;rsquo;s just how things are&amp;rdquo; as an answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started bringing that same energy to work, and it&amp;rsquo;s transformed how we approach problems in the utility space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In strategy meetings, I became the person asking:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Why do we forecast energy demand this way?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Why do we segment customers using these particular features?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Why do we assume this regulatory requirement can&amp;rsquo;t be automated?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, people were a bit put off. These questions can feel naive when you&amp;rsquo;re deep in domain expertise. But they&amp;rsquo;ve led to some of our biggest breakthroughs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One simple &amp;ldquo;why do we retrain this model monthly instead of weekly?&amp;rdquo; led us to completely redesign our MLOps pipeline and improve our peak demand forecasting accuracy significantly. Sometimes the most basic questions unlock the biggest improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best insights often hide behind the assumptions we&amp;rsquo;ve stopped questioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I now schedule &amp;ldquo;fundamental questioning&amp;rdquo; sessions quarterly where we deliberately challenge our basic assumptions about how we approach machine learning in the utility sector. The only rule: every &amp;ldquo;why&amp;rdquo; gets a real answer, not defensiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;learn-stuff-together-even-when-you-dont-know-the-answer&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#learn-stuff-together-even-when-you-dont-know-the-answer&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Learn Stuff Together (Even When You Don&amp;rsquo;t Know the Answer)
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watching my daughter discover shadows for the first time, or my son realize he can mix colors to make new ones - the pure joy of discovery is infectious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here&amp;rsquo;s the thing: I&amp;rsquo;m learning right alongside them. I don&amp;rsquo;t have all the answers about why leaves change color or how airplanes stay up. We figure it out together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This completely changed how I approach new challenges at work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of feeling like I need to be the expert on everything from transformer models to grid optimization, I started saying: &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know, let&amp;rsquo;s figure it out together.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we needed to implement computer vision for infrastructure inspection, instead of bringing in expensive consultants, I formed a learning team. I participated not as the director with all the answers, but as someone equally curious about how this technology could work in our specific context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project took longer than it might have with outside experts, but something amazing happened - the entire team&amp;rsquo;s confidence and capability grew exponentially. They owned the solution because they built it together. More importantly, they could troubleshoot and improve it without depending on external resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The best leaders create environments where everyone gets to discover and learn together.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;make-it-safe-to-mess-up&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#make-it-safe-to-mess-up&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Make It Safe to Mess Up
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;My son built this elaborate castle out of magnetic tiles last week. Spent 30 minutes on it, was so proud. Then he accidentally knocked it over while reaching for something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was ready for a meltdown. Instead, he looked at the pieces and said, &amp;ldquo;Now I can build something even cooler!&amp;rdquo; and started over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That resilience didn&amp;rsquo;t happen overnight. It developed because we&amp;rsquo;ve always treated mistakes as learning opportunities, not disasters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realized my data science teams needed that same psychological safety, especially when working in an environment where C-suite priorities shift like weather patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started being more open about my own mistakes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sharing my &amp;ldquo;learning moments&amp;rdquo; in team meetings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Running &amp;ldquo;failure retrospectives&amp;rdquo; focused on what we learned, not who screwed up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Celebrating bold attempts, even when they didn&amp;rsquo;t work out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being transparent about organizational changes while maintaining confidence in our team&amp;rsquo;s mission&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After one particularly visible project failure - a customer segmentation model that completely missed the mark - instead of looking for someone to blame, I guided the team through a learning-focused retrospective. The insights from that session informed our next attempt, which became one of our most successful customer analytics initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More importantly, people started proposing bolder ideas because they weren&amp;rsquo;t afraid of being punished for trying something that might not work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-shield-between-chaos-and-execution&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#the-shield-between-chaos-and-execution&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Shield Between Chaos and Execution
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is where parenting really prepared me for utility leadership. Kids need consistency even when the adult world is chaotic. My 4-year-old doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to know that I&amp;rsquo;m stressed about work - he just needs his bedtime routine to happen reliably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way, my data science teams don&amp;rsquo;t need to absorb every strategic pivot, reorganization, or C-suite shuffle. They need consistent support, clear priorities, and protection from organizational turbulence so they can focus on building great models and solving real problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My job became less about managing up and more about buffering down.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When leadership announces another &amp;ldquo;transformation initiative,&amp;rdquo; I translate it into: &amp;ldquo;Here&amp;rsquo;s what this means for our current projects, here&amp;rsquo;s what stays the same, and here&amp;rsquo;s how we&amp;rsquo;re going to continue delivering value.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When priorities shift quarterly, I help the team understand which core capabilities remain constant and which tactical directions might evolve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The best gift you can give your team isn&amp;rsquo;t perfect information - it&amp;rsquo;s consistent support and clear focus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-changed-and-what-it-actually-looks-like&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#what-changed-and-what-it-actually-looks-like&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What Changed (And What It Actually Looks Like)
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before Kids (The &amp;ldquo;Expert&amp;rdquo; Approach)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jump straight to technical solutions when people bring problems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feel pressure to have all the ML answers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on individual model performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Treat failed experiments as wasted resources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After Kids (The &amp;ldquo;Human&amp;rdquo; Approach)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Listen first, understand the real problem, then solve&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comfortable saying &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know this domain, let&amp;rsquo;s learn together&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on team learning and collective capability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Treat failed experiments as essential learning investments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-practical-results&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#the-practical-results&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Practical Results
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Employee satisfaction metrics around trust in leadership and engagement showed strong improvements after we implemented the &amp;ldquo;understand first&amp;rdquo; approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Innovation attempts increased significantly after we created psychological safety around experimentation failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Team capability grew faster when we learned new ML techniques together instead of always bringing in outside consultants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better solutions emerged when we actually understood business problems before trying to optimize algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-uncomfortable-truth-about-technical-leadership&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#the-uncomfortable-truth-about-technical-leadership&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Uncomfortable Truth About Technical Leadership
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what parenting taught me that all the data science leadership content missed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical expertise isn&amp;rsquo;t what makes great leaders.&lt;/strong&gt; The ability to create environments where people feel understood, curious, and safe to experiment - that&amp;rsquo;s what makes great leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The smartest person in the room isn&amp;rsquo;t always the best leader.&lt;/strong&gt; Sometimes the best leader is the person asking the most basic questions or admitting they don&amp;rsquo;t understand the business context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Innovation requires psychological safety.&lt;/strong&gt; Data scientists won&amp;rsquo;t propose creative approaches if they&amp;rsquo;re afraid of looking stupid or being blamed when experiments don&amp;rsquo;t yield immediate results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real empathy is work.&lt;/strong&gt; It means putting aside your own technical agenda and really trying to understand someone else&amp;rsquo;s experience with the tools, processes, and organizational pressures they face daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-this-looks-like-in-practice&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#what-this-looks-like-in-practice&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What This Looks Like in Practice
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start Every Problem Conversation with Understanding&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead of: &amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s tune the hyperparameters&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try: &amp;ldquo;Help me understand how this model&amp;rsquo;s performance is impacting your workflow&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask Fundamental Questions Regularly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead of: Accepting &amp;ldquo;that&amp;rsquo;s standard practice in utilities&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try: &amp;ldquo;Why is this the best approach for our specific use case?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learn Alongside Your Team&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead of: &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll bring in a consultant to teach you transformers&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try: &amp;ldquo;I haven&amp;rsquo;t worked with this architecture either - let&amp;rsquo;s figure it out together&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make Experimentation Safe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead of: &amp;ldquo;Why didn&amp;rsquo;t this model perform better?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try: &amp;ldquo;What did we learn from this experiment that will help our next approach?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;so-where-do-we-go-from-here&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#so-where-do-we-go-from-here&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;So Where Do We Go From Here?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;My kids don&amp;rsquo;t care about my technical credentials or management philosophy. They just want me to pay attention, be curious, and create a safe space for them to grow and explore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My data science teams need exactly the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best technical leaders aren&amp;rsquo;t the ones with the deepest ML expertise - they&amp;rsquo;re the ones who can create environments where everyone feels heard, stays curious, and isn&amp;rsquo;t afraid to try new approaches to solving complex problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if your leadership approach feels stale, maybe the best teachers aren&amp;rsquo;t in the conference rooms or technical blogs. Maybe they&amp;rsquo;re the ones asking &amp;ldquo;why&amp;rdquo; for the hundredth time today while building something amazing out of blocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four years into this parenting and leadership journey, I&amp;rsquo;m convinced that the human skills matter way more than the technical ones. My kids keep teaching me that every day - especially when I&amp;rsquo;m trying to shield them from the chaos while helping them build something beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Align Data Science with Business Strategy (And Stop Being a Science Project Team)</title>
        <link>http://192.168.100.63:1313/datascience/businessstrategy/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 14:30:00 -0400</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://192.168.100.63:1313/datascience/businessstrategy/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://192.168.100.63:1313/img/head/business.png" alt="Featured image of post How to Align Data Science with Business Strategy (And Stop Being a Science Project Team)" /&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;ai-summary&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#ai-summary&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;AI Summary
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most data science teams solve technically interesting problems that create zero business value because they never question whether the problem is worth solving&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;True transformation happens when data scientists embed with business consumers to understand their actual workflows, constraints, and decision-making processes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Success comes from ruthless focus on extracting value, not from building impressive models that sit unused&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The gap between data science potential and business reality stems from misaligned incentives, not technical limitations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;stop-being-the-cool-data-team-nobody-actually-uses&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#stop-being-the-cool-data-team-nobody-actually-uses&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Stop Being the &amp;ldquo;Cool Data Team&amp;rdquo; Nobody Actually Uses
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The request seemed straightforward enough: predict which pole-top transformers will fail before they blow up. Classic predictive maintenance. Sexy AI problem. The kind of project that gets executives nodding approvingly in steering committee meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My team dove in with enthusiasm. Weather data, load patterns, maintenance histories, asset ages. We built a sophisticated model that could predict transformer failures with decent accuracy. Months of work, impressive technical depth, ready for production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I started questioning the fundamental premise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went back to the engineer who requested it. &amp;ldquo;Walk me through what happens when we get these predictions. What changes in your workflow?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer was illuminating: &amp;ldquo;Well, we run pole-top transformers to failure. When they blow, it usually doesn&amp;rsquo;t affect many customers. They&amp;rsquo;re quick, easy, and cheap to replace.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What changes?&lt;/em&gt; Nothing. Absolutely nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Factor in false positives - the cost of unnecessarily replacing functioning equipment - and our sophisticated prediction model was worse than useless. It was actively destructive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This wasn&amp;rsquo;t a failure of data science. This was a failure of alignment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-uncomfortable-truth-about-most-data-science-work&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#the-uncomfortable-truth-about-most-data-science-work&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Uncomfortable Truth About Most Data Science Work
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After wrestling with this problem across multiple projects, a pattern emerged. The majority of data science initiatives in large organizations are solutions in search of problems. They&amp;rsquo;re technically impressive, methodologically sound, and completely divorced from business reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conventional wisdom about data science teams is starting to show its cracks. Companies pour millions into analytics capabilities, hire brilliant technical talent, and wonder why their ROI remains stubbornly elusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not because the math is wrong. It&amp;rsquo;s because nobody asked the right business questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-actually-drives-business-value&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#what-actually-drives-business-value&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What Actually Drives Business Value
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pivot point where the whole situation shifts is when data scientists stop thinking like researchers and start thinking like business partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;rsquo;t just theory; this is from the front lines of enterprise data science in a heavily regulated utility environment. The transformation didn&amp;rsquo;t come from better algorithms or bigger compute budgets. It came from fundamentally changing how we approached problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embed with Your Consumers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most impactful change we made was getting our data scientists out of their offices and into the field with the people who would actually use our work. Not occasional check-ins or requirements meetings. Deep embedding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our analysts started spending time with vegetation managers, understanding their seasonal planning cycles and budget constraints. They sat with customer service representatives during storm events, watching how decisions get made under pressure. They attended safety briefings with field crews to understand operational realities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This immersion revealed something critical: the gap between what we thought people needed and what they actually needed was enormous. More importantly, it built the trust required for real adoption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question Every Problem Statement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we build anything now, we run through a brutal filter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who makes decisions based on this analysis?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do they use for those decisions today?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How will our work integrate into their existing workflow?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What specific action changes if our predictions are accurate?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s the cost of being wrong?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we can&amp;rsquo;t answer these questions clearly, the project dies. No exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach challenges some long-held industry assumptions about the value of data-driven insights. Insights without decision changes are expensive trivia. We&amp;rsquo;re not in the business of producing interesting trivia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design for Operations, Not Presentations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subtle detail that changes the entire equation is this: most data science work is designed to impress stakeholders, not to integrate with operational systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Models that require manual interpretation don&amp;rsquo;t scale. Dashboards that need explanation don&amp;rsquo;t get used. Recommendations that don&amp;rsquo;t fit into existing approval processes get ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started designing everything with operational constraints as primary requirements. Regulatory compliance, union agreements, procurement cycles - these aren&amp;rsquo;t afterthoughts. They&amp;rsquo;re the foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-portfolio-reality-check&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#the-portfolio-reality-check&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Portfolio Reality Check
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all problems are worth solving, even if they&amp;rsquo;re technically solvable. This realization introduces a new layer of complexity that most data science teams ignore: resource allocation based on business impact rather than technical interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We implemented a ruthless triage system:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High-Impact, Clear ROI Projects&lt;/strong&gt; get the majority of our resources. These are problems where the business case is obvious, the decision-makers are identified, and the integration path is clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capability-Building Initiatives&lt;/strong&gt; get limited investment. These might not have immediate payoff but build technical or organizational capabilities we&amp;rsquo;ll need for future high-impact work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pure Exploration&lt;/strong&gt; gets minimal resources. Yes, we still do some blue-sky thinking, but it&amp;rsquo;s a small percentage of our portfolio and it&amp;rsquo;s time-boxed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core principle to carry forward is this: every project must pass the &amp;ldquo;so what?&amp;rdquo; test. If you can&amp;rsquo;t explain why the business should care in terms they understand, you&amp;rsquo;re probably solving the wrong problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;navigating-the-cultural-transformation&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#navigating-the-cultural-transformation&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Navigating the Cultural Transformation
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach renders the old way of doing data science obsolete. Some team members struggle with the shift from academic-style research to business-focused problem-solving. That&amp;rsquo;s predictable and manageable with the right framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For Data Scientists:&lt;/strong&gt; Learn the business model. Understand how revenue is generated, what the major cost drivers are, and where your organization&amp;rsquo;s competitive advantages come from. You can&amp;rsquo;t optimize what you don&amp;rsquo;t understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For Business Stakeholders:&lt;/strong&gt; Invest in basic data literacy. Not statistics or programming, but understanding what&amp;rsquo;s realistic versus science fiction. Most business leaders have unrealistic expectations about what data science can deliver and unrealistic timelines for delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For Leadership:&lt;/strong&gt; Create accountability structures that reward business impact, not technical sophistication. If your data science team can&amp;rsquo;t explain their value in dollars, they&amp;rsquo;re probably not creating value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-success-actually-looks-like&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#what-success-actually-looks-like&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What Success Actually Looks Like
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transformation isn&amp;rsquo;t measured by model accuracy or technical publications. It&amp;rsquo;s measured by whether business leaders fight for your team&amp;rsquo;s time instead of questioning your budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When data science teams truly align with business strategy, executives stop asking &amp;ldquo;What does the data science team actually do?&amp;rdquo; and start asking &amp;ldquo;How quickly can we expand this to other areas?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Projects move from PowerPoint to production because they&amp;rsquo;re designed for integration from day one. Teams stop defending their existence and start driving strategic discussions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-implementation-reality&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#the-implementation-reality&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Implementation Reality
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;My hope is that this provides a new lens for your own work, but let&amp;rsquo;s be realistic about the challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cultural change takes time. Technical teams resist business focus because it feels like compromising intellectual rigor. Business teams remain skeptical because they&amp;rsquo;ve been burned by previous &amp;ldquo;data initiatives&amp;rdquo; that promised transformation and delivered dashboards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The path forward requires persistent focus on problems that actually matter to the business, ruthless elimination of science projects, and obsessive attention to operational integration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ultimate takeaway is this: the future belongs to organizations that turn data into better decisions, not organizations with the most sophisticated models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the most elegant algorithm in the world is worthless if it predicts failures of equipment that&amp;rsquo;s cheaper to run to failure anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stop being a science project. Start being a strategic partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your budget - and your organization&amp;rsquo;s competitive advantage - depends on it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="http://192.168.100.63:1313/img/head/techdebt.png" alt="Featured image of post How to Scale Your Data Science Team Without Everything Falling Apart" /&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;ai-summary&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#ai-summary&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;AI Summary
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communication complexity explodes exponentially as teams grow, creating coordination nightmares that kill productivity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Traditional functional silos (separate data engineering, modeling, deployment teams) create bottlenecks that slow everything down&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;End-to-end squad structures and platform thinking are the antidotes to scaling chaos&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strategic technical debt management and tiered governance prevent bureaucracy from strangling innovation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-curse-of-success&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#the-curse-of-success&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Curse of Success
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You start with 2 analysts crushing it in whatever corner of the office they can find. Leadership notices the impact. Budget flows. You hire more people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two years later? You&amp;rsquo;re managing 20+ data scientists across two teams, and somehow everything takes longer than when you had that scrappy duo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve lived this nightmare twice - once scaling a cross-functional intelligence team that mixed analysts, data scientists, and case officers, and most recently taking my current utility from those original 2 analysts to two teams totaling 20+ data scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The math is unforgiving, but the strategy can save you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-death-spiral-mathematics&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#the-death-spiral-mathematics&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Death Spiral Mathematics
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brutal reality of team growth isn&amp;rsquo;t just about headcount - it&amp;rsquo;s about connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 people create 10 possible communication pathways. Manageable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15 people create 105 connections. Getting complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20 people create 190 potential relationships. This is where good teams start to strain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What kills you isn&amp;rsquo;t the people - it&amp;rsquo;s the exponential complexity of keeping everyone aligned. In the intelligence community, we had the added complexity of different clearance levels creating natural silos. In utilities, it&amp;rsquo;s the technical specializations that create understanding gaps between teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;where-traditional-scaling-goes-wrong&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#where-traditional-scaling-goes-wrong&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Where Traditional Scaling Goes Wrong
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Functional Silos Build Themselves&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The natural instinct is to organize by skill: data engineers here, modelers there, deployment specialists over there. Clean org chart, clear responsibilities, total disaster for delivery speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first attempt at scaling followed this playbook. Six months later, a simple model deployment required coordinating across three teams, two managers, and a project manager just to get everyone in the same room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical Debt Compound Interest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Year 1: &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ll refactor this when we have time&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Year 2: &amp;ldquo;New hires can&amp;rsquo;t understand our legacy code&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Year 3: &amp;ldquo;It takes two sprints to add a single feature because nothing connects properly&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;rsquo;t theoretical - I&amp;rsquo;ve inherited codebases where changing a single parameter required touching 15 different files because nobody had time to build proper abstractions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-actually-works&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#what-actually-works&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What Actually Works
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Squad Structure Over Functional Teams&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pivot that changed everything: 4-7 person squads that own problems end-to-end rather than handoffs between specialized teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each squad includes the full stack - someone who understands data engineering, modeling, deployment, and business context. Not everyone needs to be expert in everything, but someone in the squad needs to understand each piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference in deployment speed was immediate and dramatic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Platform Thinking Changes the Game&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individual brilliance doesn&amp;rsquo;t scale. Platform leverage does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of every data scientist building their own infrastructure, we invested heavily in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feature stores that everyone uses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One-click deployment pipelines that handle 90% of common use cases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Self-service analytics tools that reduce ad-hoc requests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six months of platform investment unlocked productivity gains that compounded as we added more people. New hires became productive in weeks instead of months because the infrastructure already existed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategic Technical Debt Management&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all technical debt is created equal. We maintain a debt registry that tracks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What the debt is&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What it costs us in velocity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What it would take to fix&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Business impact if left alone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we allocate 20% of sprint capacity to paying down the expensive stuff first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach cut our production incidents by nearly half while actually increasing feature velocity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-scaling-stages-ive-observed&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#the-scaling-stages-ive-observed&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Scaling Stages I&amp;rsquo;ve Observed
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage 1: The Scrappy Team (2-8 people)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone does everything. Context switching is constant but manageable. Proving value is the primary objective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This stage feels chaotic but moves fast. Don&amp;rsquo;t try to over-optimize here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage 2: Growing Pains (8-20 people)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where most teams either figure it out or die slowly. You need process without killing speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key insight: You can&amp;rsquo;t preserve what made the small team great - you have to evolve into what works at the new scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage 3: Scaled Function (20+ people)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Platform thinking becomes essential. Real governance matters. Coordination becomes a skill unto itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building my current utility team from 2 to 20+ across two specialized teams, I had to consciously introduce Stage 2 processes at the right inflection points. It felt like slowing down to speed up, but it prevented the chaos I&amp;rsquo;d seen derail other scaling efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;metrics-that-actually-matter&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#metrics-that-actually-matter&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Metrics That Actually Matter
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditional metrics miss the point. Track these instead:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time from idea to production&lt;/strong&gt; - Should stay flat or improve as you scale&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deployment frequency&lt;/strong&gt; - How often you actually ship working solutions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Onboarding time&lt;/strong&gt; - How fast new people become productive contributors&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintenance overhead&lt;/strong&gt; - Percentage of time keeping things running versus building new capability&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cross-team collaboration&lt;/strong&gt; - Are people working together or retreating into silos?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-uncomfortable-evolution&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#the-uncomfortable-evolution&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Uncomfortable Evolution
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The things that make small teams effective become liabilities at scale:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minimal process becomes coordination chaos. Informal communication becomes information silos. Everyone doing everything becomes nobody owning anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the answer isn&amp;rsquo;t bureaucracy - it&amp;rsquo;s intentional evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The principles stay constant: speed, ownership, experimentation, measurable impact. The implementation changes: structure that enables rather than constrains, platforms that amplify individual contributions, teams that preserve autonomy within aligned direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-real-challenge&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#the-real-challenge&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Real Challenge
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most data science teams that scale successfully don&amp;rsquo;t preserve what they had - they evolve into what they need to become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal isn&amp;rsquo;t staying small. It&amp;rsquo;s staying effective at whatever size your business demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the alternative is becoming one of those expensive teams that produces impressive slide decks and minimal business impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After scaling teams in both intelligence and utility contexts, the pattern is clear: scaling isn&amp;rsquo;t about doing more of the same thing. It&amp;rsquo;s about doing fundamentally different things that work at the new scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The math doesn&amp;rsquo;t lie - but neither does intentional strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Scale a Data Science Team Without Losing Agility</title>
        <link>http://192.168.100.63:1313/datascience/agility/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 30 Jan 2025 14:30:00 -0400</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://192.168.100.63:1313/datascience/agility/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://192.168.100.63:1313/img/head/agile.png" alt="Featured image of post How to Scale a Data Science Team Without Losing Agility" /&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;ai-summary&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#ai-summary&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;AI Summary
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scaling from 2 analysts to 20+ data scientists requires evolving from scrappy execution to structured operations while preserving speed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infrastructure dependencies become the primary scaling constraint in most enterprise environments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rigorous best practices early on actually accelerate agility as teams grow - you pay yourself back later&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Formalization becomes mandatory as you grow, but it should enable faster execution, not slow it down&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-reality-check-nobody-talks-about&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#the-reality-check-nobody-talks-about&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Reality Check Nobody Talks About
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six years ago, I walked into a room with two analysts and a mandate to build something bigger. Today, I&amp;rsquo;m running a 20+ person data science organization spanning multiple business units, covering everything from operational optimization to customer experience modeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conventional scaling wisdom - squads, agile methodologies, minimal process - isn&amp;rsquo;t wrong. But it&amp;rsquo;s incomplete when you&amp;rsquo;re operating in any enterprise environment where your biggest constraint isn&amp;rsquo;t team dynamics or technical debt. It&amp;rsquo;s waiting months for infrastructure teams to align with your growth trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me walk you through what actually happens when you scale a data science team in the real world, not the startup fantasy version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-infrastructure-chokepoint&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#the-infrastructure-chokepoint&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Infrastructure Chokepoint
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first hard lesson: your technical infrastructure will become your primary scaling bottleneck before you hit any of the sexy organizational challenges everyone writes about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enterprise IT organizations have their own priorities, their own timelines, and their own risk tolerance. When you need new environments, tools, or access provisioned, you&amp;rsquo;re not just asking for resources - you&amp;rsquo;re asking them to deviate from their carefully orchestrated roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three-month delay for a single workspace deployment taught me more about enterprise scaling than any management book ever could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reality forces a different kind of strategic thinking. You can&amp;rsquo;t just hire more people and expect linear productivity gains. You have to sequence your growth around infrastructure availability, which means getting really good at forecasting your technical needs 6-12 months ahead of your hiring plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practical solution: build relationships with infrastructure teams early, understand their constraints, and align your scaling timeline with their capacity. It&amp;rsquo;s not glamorous, but it&amp;rsquo;s the difference between a team that grows smoothly and one that spends half its time waiting for access to tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-production-ready-paradox&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#the-production-ready-paradox&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Production-Ready Paradox
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s where most data science scaling advice falls apart: it assumes you have the luxury of iterative improvement from prototype to production. In most enterprise environments with real business impact, that&amp;rsquo;s not sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My team produces more models than our deployment pipeline can handle. The bottleneck isn&amp;rsquo;t ideation or experimentation - it&amp;rsquo;s getting things into production. The solution isn&amp;rsquo;t hiring more deployment engineers; it&amp;rsquo;s changing how data scientists operate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I understand that not every team can require full production-grade code from day one. Your MLOps maturity, tooling, and business context all factor into what&amp;rsquo;s realistic. But here&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned: &lt;strong&gt;implementing rigorous best practices early, while it seems to stifle agility, actually accelerates it as you scale.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You pay yourself back later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When data scientists write clean, documented, testable code from the start - even if it&amp;rsquo;s not fully production-ready - the compound benefits are massive:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Faster code reviews and collaboration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easier debugging and maintenance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smoother handoffs to deployment teams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduced technical debt that would otherwise cripple velocity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mindset shift is crucial: &lt;em&gt;we&amp;rsquo;re not researchers exploring possibilities; we&amp;rsquo;re engineers building systems that solve business problems.&lt;/em&gt; The rigor isn&amp;rsquo;t about crushing creativity - it&amp;rsquo;s about making creativity sustainable at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;when-to-put-away-childish-things&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#when-to-put-away-childish-things&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;When to Put Away Childish Things
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a moment in every scaling journey where informal processes stop working. You can feel it coming - decisions take longer, coordination becomes painful, and new team members struggle to understand how things actually get done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where the startup mentality has to evolve. Not abandoned - evolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The early scrappy approach that got you from 2 to 8 people will kill you at 20. But the solution isn&amp;rsquo;t to swing completely into bureaucracy. It&amp;rsquo;s about formalizing the things that enable speed, not the things that slow you down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we formalized:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code standards and review processes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Model governance and risk assessment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Value capture documentation and ROI tracking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cross-functional collaboration protocols&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we kept informal:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experimental project approval&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Individual learning and development paths&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Day-to-day team coordination&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technical architecture decisions within established patterns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key insight: formalization should accelerate decision-making for routine work, preserving the informal speed for the work that actually requires creativity and judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-multi-business-unit-complexity-layer&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#the-multi-business-unit-complexity-layer&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Multi-Business Unit Complexity Layer
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scaling across multiple business units adds a dimension that most scaling advice ignores entirely. You&amp;rsquo;re not just managing team growth - you&amp;rsquo;re managing different stakeholder expectations, varying technical maturity levels, and competing priorities that may not align.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each business unit has its own definition of success, its own timeline pressures, and its own tolerance for experimentation. What works for supply chain optimization in one area might be completely inappropriate for customer analytics in another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution isn&amp;rsquo;t trying to force standardization everywhere. It&amp;rsquo;s about building &lt;em&gt;platforms&lt;/em&gt; that can accommodate different use cases while maintaining consistency in governance and quality standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We built shared infrastructure - feature stores, deployment pipelines, monitoring systems - but allowed flexibility in how each business unit applied the capabilities to their specific challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;value-capture-as-a-scaling-strategy&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#value-capture-as-a-scaling-strategy&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Value Capture as a Scaling Strategy
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As your team grows, the pressure to demonstrate ROI becomes exponentially more intense. A two-person analytics team can fly under the radar. A 20-person organization with a multi-million-dollar budget cannot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where many data science teams fail. They treat value capture as an afterthought, something to document after the fact for reporting purposes. But at scale, value capture becomes a core competency that determines whether you continue to grow or get budget-cut into irrelevance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our approach:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every project starts with a business case and success metrics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We track not just technical performance but business impact&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quarterly reviews focus on outcomes, not outputs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We proactively communicate wins and learnings to stakeholders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The uncomfortable truth: at scale, your technical excellence matters less than your ability to articulate and capture business value. Teams that can&amp;rsquo;t make this transition don&amp;rsquo;t survive budget cycles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-rigor-dividend&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#the-rigor-dividend&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Rigor Dividend
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest misconception about scaling data science teams is that more process means less agility. In my experience, the opposite is true - but only if you implement the right kind of rigor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rigorous code standards feel slow when you&amp;rsquo;re starting out. But six months later, when you can onboard new team members in days instead of weeks, when debugging takes minutes instead of hours, when models can be updated and deployed without archaeology projects to understand the original code - that&amp;rsquo;s when you realize you&amp;rsquo;ve been paying yourself back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The teams that maintain agility at scale aren&amp;rsquo;t the ones that avoid process. They&amp;rsquo;re the ones that implement process strategically, focusing on the practices that create compound returns on productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-evolution-mindset&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#the-evolution-mindset&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Evolution Mindset
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest mistake I see in scaling data science teams is trying to preserve what made the early team successful instead of evolving into what the scaled team needs to become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The principles stay constant: speed, ownership, experimentation, impact. But the implementation has to change completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 20-person team can&amp;rsquo;t operate like a 5-person team any more than a 5-person team should operate like a 20-person team. The magic is in evolving the structure to support the principles at whatever scale your business requires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the alternative - becoming one of those expensive teams that produces impressive PowerPoints and minimal business impact - isn&amp;rsquo;t just a failure of process. It&amp;rsquo;s a failure to recognize that scaling is fundamentally about evolution, not preservation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The math of team growth is unforgiving, but so is the market for data science value. Teams that figure out how to evolve while staying effective don&amp;rsquo;t just survive scaling - they become indispensable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in a world where data science budgets are under constant scrutiny, indispensable is exactly where you want to be.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What Business Leaders Get Wrong About Data Science (And How to Educate Them)</title>

        <description>&lt;img src="http://192.168.100.63:1313/img/head/leaders.png" alt="Featured image of post What Business Leaders Get Wrong About Data Science (And How to Educate Them)" /&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;ai-summary&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#ai-summary&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;AI Summary
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Business leaders often treat data science like magic, expecting perfect predictions from inherently uncertain systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The biggest project failures stem from misaligned expectations, not technical limitations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most data science work involves stakeholder collaboration and data preparation, not just modeling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Direct, pragmatic communication can shift executive thinking from fantasy to realistic optimism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;your-executives-think-data-science-is-magic-and-its-killing-your-projects&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#your-executives-think-data-science-is-magic-and-its-killing-your-projects&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Your Executives Think Data Science is Magic (And It&amp;rsquo;s Killing Your Projects)
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Can&amp;rsquo;t we just use AI to predict exactly how many customers will lose power during the storm?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve fielded this question in boardrooms more times than I can count. The executive asking is genuinely excited about possibilities, completely sincere about leveraging data better, and absolutely clueless about what they&amp;rsquo;re actually requesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The enthusiasm is fantastic. The expectations? Pure fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After watching brilliant data science teams crash into unrealistic business expectations repeatedly, I&amp;rsquo;ve learned that our biggest obstacle isn&amp;rsquo;t technical complexity. It&amp;rsquo;s the chasm between what executives think data science can do and what it actually delivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The uncomfortable truth: most business leaders think data science is magic. Until we fix that misconception, we&amp;rsquo;ll keep building amazing solutions that nobody uses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-top-5-fantasies-business-leaders-harbor-about-data-science&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#the-top-5-fantasies-business-leaders-harbor-about-data-science&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Top 5 Fantasies Business Leaders Harbor About Data Science
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fantasy #1: &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s All About Sophisticated AI Algorithms&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What they think: Data scientists spend their days crafting elegant AI models that solve business problems automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality: About 5% of data science is actual modeling. The rest breaks down to roughly 50% working with stakeholders and 40% wrestling with messy data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve all watched companies burn through millions on &amp;ldquo;AI initiatives&amp;rdquo; before realizing their foundational data was scattered across incompatible systems with inconsistent formats. They would have been infinitely better off spending that first investment on basic data integration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This matters because when executives fixate on algorithms instead of data infrastructure and stakeholder alignment, they set impossible timelines and get frustrated when teams spend months on &amp;ldquo;boring&amp;rdquo; foundational work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fantasy #2: &amp;ldquo;More Data Equals Better Results&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What they think: The path to insights involves collecting every conceivable piece of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality: Most companies are drowning in irrelevant data while missing the information they actually need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take our advanced metering infrastructure data - we were storing millions of records per hour when only a few unique flags were really necessary for decision making. The computational overhead was killing our processing efficiency, making even simple analyses take far longer than they should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This matters because data hoarding creates expensive storage costs, analysis paralysis, and performance bottlenecks without delivering any measurable value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fantasy #3: &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ll See ROI Immediately&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What they think: Data science projects should deliver clear returns within a quarter, like purchasing new software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality: There&amp;rsquo;s a healthy balance between immediate tactical wins and longer-term strategic value. We&amp;rsquo;ve built models where executives expected immediate returns, but the real value played out over the course of years, not months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fantasy #4: &amp;ldquo;Any Competent Data Scientist Can Solve Any Problem&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What they think: Data scientists are universal problem solvers who can tackle anything with sufficient data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality: Data science is incredibly specialized. A recommendation system expert might struggle with time series forecasting. A statistics expert might know nothing about deep learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we organized our team around domains of expertise instead of treating everyone as interchangeable, projects finished much faster and had fewer failures. But most importantly, they achieved better adoption because we could communicate effectively with the people who would be using the solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fantasy #5: &amp;ldquo;Data Science Provides Definitive Answers&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What they think: Models will tell us exactly what will happen and exactly what actions to take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality: Most data science is statistics under the hood, which generally involves probability, not certainties. A model might indicate a customer has a 70% chance of experiencing an outage - it can&amp;rsquo;t guarantee they will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most challenging resistance I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered was around a weather prediction model designed to forecast power outages. Weather is inherently variable, making precise outage predictions nearly impossible. Some executives felt our model should achieve much higher accuracy than physics actually allows. It required extensive pragmatic discussions and retrospective analysis to demonstrate what was genuinely feasible versus what they wished was possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-to-bridge-the-gap-without-crushing-their-dreams&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#how-to-bridge-the-gap-without-crushing-their-dreams&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;How to Bridge the Gap (Without Crushing Their Dreams)
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speak Business, Not Technical&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t say: &amp;ldquo;We improved model accuracy by 12%&amp;rdquo;
Say: &amp;ldquo;We reduced customer acquisition costs by identifying better prospects&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t say: &amp;ldquo;We need to address data quality issues&amp;rdquo;
Say: &amp;ldquo;Poor data is adding months to every project timeline&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you translate technical work into business outcomes, executive engagement transforms. They weren&amp;rsquo;t less interested before - they just couldn&amp;rsquo;t connect the work to things they cared about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Show Them, Don&amp;rsquo;t Tell Them&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract explanations don&amp;rsquo;t change minds. Real experiences do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try this: Run a &amp;ldquo;Data Science Reality&amp;rdquo; workshop where executives manually clean a small dataset, then attempt to draw conclusions. The frustration they experience firsthand teaches them more than any presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or this: Create an interactive demo showing how changing data quality affects business outcomes. Let them see what happens when you feed good versus bad data into identical models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start Small and Demonstrate Value&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of trying to correct every misconception simultaneously, pick focused wins that prove your point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I once had a conversation with our COO about a circuit breaker model we&amp;rsquo;d built. Rather than trying to prove the exact failure probability, we focused on explaining how the model could help restructure a business process around maintenance scheduling. That shift from the original request ultimately proved far more efficient and effective than what was initially asked for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make Them Part of the Process&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Business leaders who participate in data science projects develop far more realistic expectations than those who just receive results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create steering committees with business representation. Involve executives in problem definition and feature selection. Hold regular open houses where they can observe work in progress. Let them spend time with the data team to understand the actual workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;make-the-hidden-costs-visible&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#make-the-hidden-costs-visible&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Make the Hidden Costs Visible
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business leaders undervalue data preparation because they don&amp;rsquo;t see its cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Track and report time spent on data prep versus modeling. Quantify the cost of poor data quality in delayed projects and missed opportunities. Create &amp;ldquo;data readiness assessments&amp;rdquo; before starting projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Document how computational inefficiency from poor data architecture affects project timelines. Make the connection between data infrastructure investments and project delivery speed explicit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-90-day-executive-education-program&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#the-90-day-executive-education-program&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The 90-Day Executive Education Program
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re serious about fixing the expectations problem, you need a structured approach:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Month 1: Reality Check&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Survey executives to identify specific misconceptions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a &amp;ldquo;data science reality&amp;rdquo; guide for your organization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Document the full process of one successful project - including all the messy parts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify focused opportunities to demonstrate value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Month 2: Experience Building&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run the &amp;ldquo;Data Science Reality&amp;rdquo; workshop for leadership&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start regular steering committee meetings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Launch at least one project with heavy executive involvement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create visibility into how data scientists actually spend their time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Month 3: New Systems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Share results from initial projects, emphasizing process as much as outcomes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implement data readiness requirements for new projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create an executive resource center with case studies and practical guides&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Establish regular reviews that address expectations versus reality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-success-actually-looks-like&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#what-success-actually-looks-like&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What Success Actually Looks Like
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before Education:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;What does the data science team actually do all day?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Projects get killed when they don&amp;rsquo;t show immediate results&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unrealistic timelines based on algorithm complexity, not data reality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frustration when &amp;ldquo;AI&amp;rdquo; doesn&amp;rsquo;t solve every problem instantly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After Education:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Executives advocating for data science resources because they understand the value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Realistic project timelines that account for data preparation and stakeholder alignment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investment in data infrastructure alongside analytics capabilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patience for experimentation and iteration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-goal-realistic-data-optimism&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#the-goal-realistic-data-optimism&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Goal: Realistic Data Optimism
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The point isn&amp;rsquo;t to crush executive enthusiasm for data science. It&amp;rsquo;s to channel that enthusiasm in productive directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most effective organizations maintain &amp;ldquo;realistic data optimism&amp;rdquo; - genuine excitement about data science potential combined with clear-eyed understanding of what it takes to achieve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They understand that data science requires ongoing investment and patience. Data quality and stakeholder alignment matter as much as analytical sophistication. Not every problem needs advanced AI - sometimes simple analytics deliver more value. Data scientists are partners, not magicians, who need context and reasonable expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-real-competitive-advantage&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#the-real-competitive-advantage&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Real Competitive Advantage
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies that extract the most value from data science aren&amp;rsquo;t necessarily those with the biggest teams or fanciest technology. They&amp;rsquo;re the ones where business and data leaders share a realistic understanding of what&amp;rsquo;s possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest advantage isn&amp;rsquo;t having superior algorithms - it&amp;rsquo;s having better alignment between your data capabilities and your business strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-essential-insight&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#the-essential-insight&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Essential Insight
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your executives&amp;rsquo; enthusiasm for data science is an asset, not a problem. But enthusiasm without understanding leads to failed projects, wasted money, and frustrated teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution isn&amp;rsquo;t to lower expectations - it&amp;rsquo;s to educate leadership about what realistic success looks like. When business leaders understand both the potential and the process of data science, something remarkable happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not the fantasy magic they initially imagined, but something better: sustainable, scalable business impact driven by data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s worth infinitely more than any algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most successful data science organizations aren&amp;rsquo;t those with the most advanced technology - they&amp;rsquo;re those with the most effective communication between business and technical teams. Start there.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Building High Impact Data Science Teams</title>
        <link>http://192.168.100.63:1313/datascience/foundations/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 13 Dec 2024 14:30:00 -0400</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://192.168.100.63:1313/datascience/foundations/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://192.168.100.63:1313/img/head/highimpact.png" alt="Featured image of post Building High Impact Data Science Teams" /&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;ai-summary&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#ai-summary&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI Summary&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most data science teams fail because they optimize for algorithmic sophistication instead of business impact.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple solutions that people actually use beat complex models that gather dust.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building balanced teams with business sense and operational thinking matters more than hiring only technical geniuses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Success requires focusing on adoption and change management, not just model accuracy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;your-data-science-team-is-probably-expensive-and-useless&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#your-data-science-team-is-probably-expensive-and-useless&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Your Data Science Team is Probably Expensive and Useless
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me guess. You hired a bunch of brilliant data scientists, gave them access to all your data, and expected magic to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six months later, you&amp;rsquo;ve got impressive demos, excited PowerPoints, and &lt;strong&gt;zero impact on the bottom line.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the club. Most companies end up with data science teams that look great on paper but accomplish nothing meaningful. They burn through budget building models nobody uses while the business keeps making decisions with gut instinct and Excel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After building data science organizations from scratch across multiple contexts - from federal agencies to major utilities - I&amp;rsquo;ve watched this disaster play out dozens of times. The good news? The fix isn&amp;rsquo;t complicated, but it requires abandoning some deeply held assumptions about what makes data science teams successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;stop-trying-to-impress-your-peers&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#stop-trying-to-impress-your-peers&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Stop Trying to Impress Your Peers
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the uncomfortable truth that took me years to fully accept: &lt;strong&gt;most business problems don&amp;rsquo;t need deep learning.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our COO once asked for a retrospective analysis of how our vegetation management program was performing under weather-normalized conditions. Simple request, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not when you&amp;rsquo;re a team that spends most of its time doing deep weather analytics work. We dive into storm impact modeling, complex outage correlations, sophisticated vegetation management algorithms. Our default mode is finding the most technically robust solution to every problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So naturally, when tasked with this retrospective, our gut reaction was to build something complex. Zero hour actuals, fine-grain resolution, multi-layered weather normalization models. The kind of analysis that would make meteorologists proud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team was already sketching out approaches that would take months to implement properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then our summer intern spoke up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;What if we just pulled all the weather station data at 5-minute intervals and applied a transformation that aligns with the Beaufort scale?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The room went quiet. Not because it was wrong, but because it was so obviously right that none of us had thought of it. We&amp;rsquo;d been so conditioned to solve complex problems with complex solutions that we&amp;rsquo;d missed the straightforward approach sitting right there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her method worked perfectly for what we actually needed to deliver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This moment crystallized something I&amp;rsquo;d been noticing throughout my decade of building and leading data science teams: our obsession with hiring only the most technically advanced people was creating more problems than it solved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before building anything, answer these three questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What specific business decision does this improve?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How will people&amp;rsquo;s daily work change?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s the simplest solution that works?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can&amp;rsquo;t answer clearly? You&amp;rsquo;re solving the wrong problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-people-problem-hint-its-not-about-finding-geniuses&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#the-people-problem-hint-its-not-about-finding-geniuses&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The People Problem (Hint: It&amp;rsquo;s Not About Finding Geniuses)
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most companies hire data science teams backwards. They chase the smartest person in the room instead of building balanced teams that can actually execute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I built our AI and Data Science Center of Excellence from the ground up, I quickly learned that getting buy-in across three operating companies meant every executive had their own take on what was important. The technical brilliance that impressed one division head meant nothing to another who just wanted his call center metrics to improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;what-actually-works&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#what-actually-works&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Actually Works:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A mix of skills, not just PhDs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical depth&lt;/strong&gt; (someone who can build models)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Business sense&lt;/strong&gt; (someone who understands the company)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Product thinking&lt;/strong&gt; (someone who can scale solutions)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Change management&lt;/strong&gt; (someone who can drive adoption)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;what-fails-every-time&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#what-fails-every-time&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Fails Every Time:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The genius trap:&lt;/strong&gt; Hiring one superstar who builds incredible models that nobody else can maintain or understand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Academia mindset:&lt;/strong&gt; Teams that optimize for publication-worthy work instead of business-ready solutions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No operational thinking:&lt;/strong&gt; Building solutions that require completely rewriting how people work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real talk: I&amp;rsquo;d rather have a decent data scientist who understands the business than a brilliant one who works in isolation. The former will build something like our GenAI Call Center Agent Assist that actually gets adopted and stays in production. The latter will build impressive demos that executives nod at and then forget about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-tech-debt-death-spiral&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#the-tech-debt-death-spiral&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Tech Debt Death Spiral
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is how most data science teams die:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Month 1:&lt;/strong&gt; Build amazing proof-of-concept&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Month 3:&lt;/strong&gt; Business wants more, so you hack together another model&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Month 6:&lt;/strong&gt; Everything&amp;rsquo;s held together with digital duct tape&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Month 12:&lt;/strong&gt; Takes three weeks to change a simple parameter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Month 18:&lt;/strong&gt; Business loses faith in data science entirely&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sound familiar?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;how-to-avoid-the-trap&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#how-to-avoid-the-trap&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Avoid the Trap:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Build like an engineer, not a researcher:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reproducible code from day one&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standardized data pipelines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Documentation that makes sense&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitoring for when things break&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simple rule:&lt;/strong&gt; If you need a PhD to understand your model, it&amp;rsquo;s too complex to scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best teams build boring, reliable solutions that work for years. Not flashy demos that break after a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-impact-actually-means&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#what-impact-actually-means&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What &amp;ldquo;Impact&amp;rdquo; Actually Means
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stop measuring success by the number of models built. Start measuring business outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In utilities, this meant tracking whether our storm restoration optimization models actually reduced customer outage minutes during the next major weather event. Whether our customer segmentation drove measurable improvements in satisfaction scores. Whether our vegetation risk forecasting led to fewer tree-related outages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;good-metrics&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#good-metrics&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good Metrics:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revenue increased by X%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Costs reduced by $Y&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customer satisfaction up Z points&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manual processes eliminated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;vanity-metrics&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#vanity-metrics&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vanity Metrics:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Model accuracy improved&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Interesting insights&amp;rdquo; discovered&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Papers published&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conference talks given&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The business doesn&amp;rsquo;t care how smart your algorithm is. They care if it makes them more money or saves them time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;team-structure-that-works&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#team-structure-that-works&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Team Structure That Works
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s no perfect org chart, but here&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned works in practice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For Small Companies (Starting Out):&lt;/strong&gt;
A centralized team of 3-5 people who do everything. Focus on proving value before worrying about structure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For Growing Companies:&lt;/strong&gt;
A hub-and-spoke model: A central team for standards and tools, with embedded people in business units. This offers the best of both worlds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For Large Companies:&lt;/strong&gt;
A federated approach: Data scientists are placed directly in business teams, with communities of practice for knowledge sharing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key insight: &lt;strong&gt;Data scientists need to be close to decision-makers,&lt;/strong&gt; not isolated in some analytics department. When I had to navigate compliance with PUC and NERC standards while building AI governance frameworks, that proximity to the actual business constraints was everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-uncomfortable-realities&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#the-uncomfortable-realities&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Uncomfortable Realities
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most Data Science Work Isn&amp;rsquo;t Sexy:&lt;/strong&gt; You&amp;rsquo;ll spend more time cleaning data and building dashboards than training neural networks. Embrace it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Change Management is Half the Job:&lt;/strong&gt; The best model in the world is worthless if people don&amp;rsquo;t change how they work. Plan for adoption from day one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simple Solutions Often Win:&lt;/strong&gt; That basic rule-based system might outperform your machine learning model when you factor in maintenance and explainability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical Debt Kills Teams:&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ve seen brilliant teams become completely ineffective because they couldn&amp;rsquo;t maintain their own work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-success-actually-looks-like&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#what-success-actually-looks-like&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What Success Actually Looks Like
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;before-transformation&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#before-transformation&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before Transformation:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Impressive technical work gathering dust&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Business making decisions without data team input&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Executives asking &amp;ldquo;what does the data science team &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; do?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Constant budget justification&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;after-transformation&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#after-transformation&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After Transformation:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Models in production driving daily decisions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Business leaders fighting for data science resources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clear ROI on every major project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data science informing company strategy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-core-principle-to-carry-forward&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#the-core-principle-to-carry-forward&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Core Principle to Carry Forward
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;High-impact data science teams don&amp;rsquo;t just build models - &lt;strong&gt;they change how businesses operate.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focus on business problems worth solving, simple solutions that scale, teams that can execute rather than just research, and measurable business outcomes. Avoid complexity for complexity&amp;rsquo;s sake, technical debt accumulation, working in isolation from the business, and vanity metrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference between successful and failed data science investments usually comes down to &lt;strong&gt;execution, not intelligence.&lt;/strong&gt; Build teams that ship useful solutions, not impressive science projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reality check:&lt;/strong&gt; If your data science team has been around for over a year and executives still don&amp;rsquo;t understand their value, the problem isn&amp;rsquo;t communication - it&amp;rsquo;s alignment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Why Hiring Only Senior Data Scientists Will Destroy Your Team</title>
        <link>http://192.168.100.63:1313/datascience/genius/</link>

        <description>&lt;img src="http://192.168.100.63:1313/img/head/genius.png" alt="Featured image of post Why Hiring Only Senior Data Scientists Will Destroy Your Team" /&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;ai-summary&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#ai-summary&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;AI Summary
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teams stacked with only senior-level talent often prioritize technical complexity over practical solutions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Junior team members and interns frequently approach problems without the constraints of &amp;ldquo;how it&amp;rsquo;s always been done&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The cost/value tradeoff of senior-heavy teams creates budget constraints that limit team growth and experimentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ego-driven technical discussions can overshadow actual problem-solving when everyone feels they need to prove their expertise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-vegetation-management-analysis-that-taught-me-everything&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#the-vegetation-management-analysis-that-taught-me-everything&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Vegetation Management Analysis That Taught Me Everything
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our COO asked for a retrospective analysis of how our vegetation management program was performing under weather-normalized conditions. Simple request, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not when you&amp;rsquo;re a team that spends most of its time doing deep weather analytics work. We dive into storm impact modeling, complex outage correlations, sophisticated vegetation management algorithms. Our default mode is finding the most technically robust solution to every problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So naturally, when tasked with this retrospective, our gut reaction was to build something complex. Zero hour actuals, fine-grain resolution, multi-layered weather normalization models. The kind of analysis that would make meteorologists proud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team was already sketching out approaches that would take months to implement properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then our summer intern spoke up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What if we just pulled all the weather station data at 5-minute intervals and applied a transformation that aligns with the Beaufort scale?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The room went quiet. Not because it was wrong, but because it was so obviously right that none of us had thought of it. We&amp;rsquo;d been so conditioned to solve complex problems with complex solutions that we&amp;rsquo;d missed the straightforward approach sitting right there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her method worked perfectly for what we actually needed to deliver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This moment crystallized something I&amp;rsquo;d been noticing throughout my decade of building and leading data science teams: our obsession with hiring only the most technically advanced people was creating more problems than it solved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-senior-trap-thats-bankrupting-your-budget&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#the-senior-trap-thats-bankrupting-your-budget&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Senior Trap That&amp;rsquo;s Bankrupting Your Budget
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the uncomfortable math that most data science leaders don&amp;rsquo;t want to face: a team of five senior data scientists costs roughly the same as a team of twelve mixed-level contributors. But which team actually delivers more value?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After leading teams through both configurations, the answer surprised me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The All-Senior Team Reality&lt;/strong&gt;
Every problem becomes a technical showcase. Simple analyses get over-engineered because everyone needs to demonstrate their expertise. What should be a straightforward regression becomes an ensemble of gradient boosting models with hyperparameter optimization and cross-validation schemes that would make academic reviewers weep with joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, you&amp;rsquo;re burning through budget at an alarming rate while moving slowly on basic deliverables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Mixed-Level Team Advantage&lt;/strong&gt;
Junior people ask &amp;ldquo;why are we doing it this way?&amp;rdquo; Senior people know how to execute when complexity is actually needed. Mid-level contributors bridge the gap and keep projects moving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result? Faster iteration, more practical solutions, and budget left over for the tools and infrastructure that actually matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;when-ego-kills-solutions&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#when-ego-kills-solutions&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;When Ego Kills Solutions
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early in my career, I made the mistake of building a team where everyone felt they needed to prove they belonged in the room. PhD vs. industry experience. Deep learning vs. traditional statistics. Python vs. R debates that consumed entire meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technical discussions weren&amp;rsquo;t about finding the best solution - they were about demonstrating individual expertise. Everyone was so busy puffing out their chest that we lost sight of what we were actually trying to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moment your team meetings become intellectual competitions instead of collaborative problem-solving sessions, you&amp;rsquo;ve lost the plot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned this lesson when we spent three weeks debating the optimal architecture for a recommendation system while our business stakeholders were getting frustrated with basic reporting delays. We had brilliant people solving the wrong problems in the most complex ways possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-fresh-eyes-factor&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#the-fresh-eyes-factor&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Fresh Eyes Factor
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s something powerful about approaching a problem without the accumulated assumptions of experience. Junior team members haven&amp;rsquo;t learned what&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;impossible&amp;rdquo; yet. They haven&amp;rsquo;t internalized the industry conventional wisdom that might be outdated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Pattern I Keep Seeing&lt;/strong&gt;
Senior person: &amp;ldquo;This is how we&amp;rsquo;ve always handled time series forecasting in utilities&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;
Junior person: &amp;ldquo;What if we treated this like a recommendation problem instead?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the junior person is wrong. But sometimes they&amp;rsquo;re seeing something the rest of us missed because we were too focused on the &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; way to do things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Questions That Change Everything&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Why can&amp;rsquo;t we just use the existing weather data?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;What if we simplified this model instead of making it more complex?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Do we actually need real-time predictions, or would daily be sufficient?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These aren&amp;rsquo;t questions that come from inexperience. They come from not being constrained by how things have always been done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-hidden-costs-of-senior-heavy-teams&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#the-hidden-costs-of-senior-heavy-teams&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Hidden Costs of Senior-Heavy Teams
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Budget Reality Check&lt;/strong&gt;
Five senior data scientists at market rate: $1.2M+ annually in salary alone
Mixed team of two seniors, four mid-level, six juniors: roughly the same cost with double the capacity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Innovation Bottleneck&lt;/strong&gt;
When everyone on the team is a domain expert, you get groupthink. Everyone approaches problems from similar angles because they&amp;rsquo;ve all learned the same &amp;ldquo;best practices.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knowledge Transfer Problem&lt;/strong&gt;
Senior-heavy teams often struggle with documentation and knowledge sharing because everyone assumes everyone else already knows the fundamentals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Client Interface Issues&lt;/strong&gt;
Sometimes you need someone who can explain technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders without drowning them in jargon. Junior team members are often better at this because they remember what it was like to not understand these concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;building-teams-that-actually-work&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#building-teams-that-actually-work&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Building Teams That Actually Work
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The 40-40-20 Rule&lt;/strong&gt;
Roughly 40% mid-level contributors who can execute reliably, 40% junior talent who bring fresh perspectives and handle routine work, 20% senior experts who tackle the genuinely complex problems and provide technical leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;rsquo;t about cutting costs - it&amp;rsquo;s about optimizing for actual output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psychological Safety Over Technical Prowess&lt;/strong&gt;
The best data science teams I&amp;rsquo;ve built prioritize asking good questions over having all the answers. When junior team members feel safe proposing simple solutions, you often discover that simple solutions work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project Rotation Strategy&lt;/strong&gt;
Give junior people ownership of complete problems, not just implementation tasks. Let them propose approaches, even if you know a more sophisticated method exists. Sometimes their approach works better. When it doesn&amp;rsquo;t, the learning experience is valuable for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-transformation-that-actually-matters&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#the-transformation-that-actually-matters&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Transformation That Actually Matters
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After restructuring my teams with this mixed-level approach, something interesting happened. The senior people started enjoying their work more. Instead of being pulled into every routine analysis, they could focus on genuinely challenging problems. Instead of proving their expertise in meetings, they were mentoring and enabling others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The junior people grew faster because they had real ownership and could see the impact of their work. The mid-level contributors became force multipliers who could translate between technical depth and practical execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Success Looks Like&lt;/strong&gt;
Projects move faster because not everything needs to be technically perfect. Budget goes further because you&amp;rsquo;re not paying senior rates for routine work. Innovation increases because diverse perspectives challenge assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, solutions get simpler and more maintainable because you have people asking &amp;ldquo;do we really need all this complexity?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-leadership-shift&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#the-leadership-shift&#34; class=&#34;header-anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Leadership Shift
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leading a mixed-level data science team requires different skills than managing a group of senior experts. You&amp;rsquo;re not just coordinating technical work - you&amp;rsquo;re developing talent, managing different learning curves, and creating an environment where diverse experience levels can contribute effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The payoff is teams that are more resilient, more innovative, and more sustainable than groups built purely on technical credentials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Question That Changes Everything&lt;/strong&gt;
Instead of asking &amp;ldquo;who&amp;rsquo;s the smartest person we can hire?&amp;rdquo; start asking &amp;ldquo;what mix of perspectives and experience levels will solve problems most effectively?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your budget, your timelines, and your actual business outcomes will thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal isn&amp;rsquo;t to avoid hiring brilliant people. It&amp;rsquo;s to build teams where brilliance can flourish alongside fresh thinking, practical execution, and sustainable growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the best solution comes from the person who doesn&amp;rsquo;t know enough to realize it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t work.&lt;/p&gt;
